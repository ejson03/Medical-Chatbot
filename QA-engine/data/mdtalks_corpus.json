However, other causes of irritation include allergies to the dye in your jeans, material of your pantyhose, allergies to the wax/shaving cream you use on your legs, etc. Certain systemic diseases can also lead to puriritis.  You should be evaluated by your physician for liver disease as a buildup of bilirubin can lead to itchiness.  Thyroid disease can also lead to pruritis.  In addition, renal failure can lead to pruritis as well. You should visit your physician or an allergist to determine the cause of your pruritis.

Can you please help me to solve it out?",
      "body": "Phlegm in the back of the throat is often a symptom of an underlying condition.  The most common causes of phlegm in the back of the throat include post nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and environmental exposure. Post nasal drip is a condition with excessive mucus production by the nasal mucosa which accumulates in the back of the nose or the throat.  Patients often report symptoms such as constant swallowing, frequent spitting, difficulty breathing, and coughing.  Post nasal drip is often caused by allergic rhinitis but it can also be caused by sinusitis or GERD.  Treatment includes antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, antibiotics for sinusitis, and proton pump inhibitors for GERD. GERD, also known as acid reflux, is a disease characterized by constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.  Patients often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation.  Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping.  Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. Lastly, environmental exposure can cause excessive phlegm production.  Smoking or second hand smoke is one of the most common cause of phlegm.  Other irritants or allergens such as pollen, mold, fumes, pet dander, etc. can also cause an increased production in phlegm.  Treatment involves identifying and eliminating the source. In your case, the likely culprits from your excessive phlegm include allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, gastric reflux, or an environmental exposure.  An evaluation by your doctor to identify possible causes of your phlegm production would include a physical exam and careful history.  If appropriate, antibiotics to treat an underlying infection, antihistamines to treat post nasal drip, or a trial of proton pump inhibitors to treat GERD might be indicated.   ",

      "body": "Itchy and swollen feet as you are describing can be a number of possibilities including but not limited to cardiovascular problems, diabetes, dermatitis, insect bites, or fungal infections. Given that you are complaining of feet swelling when you stand or walk, this could be an underlying sign of cardiovascular problems such as heart failure.  Heart failure leads to poor circulatory effort and decreased venous return thereby leading to pooling of fluids in the lowest part of your body \u2013 your feet.  A similar problem arises with diabetes whereby the small vessels and nerves in your feet are damaged by high blood sugar and fluid pools in your feet causing swelling.  The itchiness and spots you are seeing could be a result of irritation due to this swelling. Dermatitis and insect bites can both cause inflammatory reactions in your feet causing swelling and itchiness.  Dermatitis results from contact with something that irritates your skin \u2013 the leather or dye on new sandals, nickel on toe rings, poison ivy, new detergent used to wash your socks, etc.  Insect bites such as mosquitoes, bed bugs, etc. can cause similar symptoms. Lastly fungal infections such as \u201cathletes foot\u201d can cause similar symptoms.  This is a fungal infection causing itching and blisters to develop as well as scaling and flaking of the affected areas.  Treatment can be with topical antifungals such as lotramin (available over the counter) or with prescription oral antifungals. If your feet have been progressively swelling, swollen for weeks, you have heart problems, you suspect a fungal infection, or you have diabetes, a visit to your primary care physician to evaluate the symptoms and proper control of your underlying condition would be warranted.  If you suspect dermatitis, remove the suspected irritant from your feet and treat with anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl.  If other people in your family have similar swelling and itchiness, you suspect insect bites, anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl could be  ",

Studies have shown second generation H1 antihistamines to have either similar or greater efficacy in relieving symptoms than topical cromoglycate, montelukast, and nedocromil.

The most likely suspect in this situation is the thyroxine you are taking but it can also be a variety of other factors. In layman\u2019s terms, thyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone that is inactive until is broken down in the liver to produce active thyroid hormone T3.  The liver is also the source of triglycerides.  In some people, the process of breaking down thyroxine into T3 also releases triglycerides which may result in hypertriglyceridemia.  Other causes of hypertriglyceridemia include copper, calcium, or magnesium deficiencies, as well as estrogen therapy. Although a triglyceride level of 180 is not a desirable outcome, there is tremendous benefit in becoming euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone values).  However, you should follow your triglycerides and cholesterol closely and if they continue to rise, you may need to alter your medications.  ",

The onset, duration, and frequency of hot flashes vary from woman to woman so there is no fixed number of hot flashes per day that is considered \u201cnormal.\u201d  Hot flashes can be triggered by environmental and dietary factors.  Patients should avoid warm environments, spicy foods, and consuming caffeine.  In addition, cigarette smoking and stress can also trigger hot flashes.  Hormone replacement therapy has been used to treat hot flashes but alternatives exist.  Evening of Primose oil has been used to treat menopausal symptoms but it may take weeks to months before effects are experienced.  Vitamin E supplementation has also been shown to decrease hot flashes.  Lastly, a diet rich in soy and low in red meat can decrease the frequency of hot flashes. Lastly, your symptoms of \u201ca sick feeling in my stomache, my vision gets slightly blurred, my heart pounds rapidly, and I sweat terribly\u201d is also suspicious of heart arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytomas.

      "body": "The rule of thumb for pediatric cardiology is that diastolic murmurs are always abnormal but systolic murmurs can be benign or a sign of a structural abnormality.  Your grandson has a systolic murmur.  Pediatric cardiologists estimate that benign murmurs can be heard in nearly 90% of children.  Without a clinical exam and ultrasound imaging, it is impossible to determine if your grandson\u2019s murmur is benign or suspicious but it is wise to have him further evaluated. The next step in your grandson\u2019s workup is a referral to a pediatric cardiologist, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and/or imaging of the heart with an ultrasound machine.  With those pieces of information, your child\u2019s pediatrician can make an informed decision for your grandson\u2019s care. ",

      "body": "The most likely cause of your dizziness when changing positions is orthostatic hypotension.  Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate. The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting. These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.  Common causes of orthostatic hypotension include volume depletion, neurologic abnormalities, and medication. If raising your arms causes you dizziness, you should be evaluated by a doctor for a physical exam \u2013 especially if you can consistently replicate the symptoms.  Commonly, compression of the large blood vessels in the neck/upper thorax can produce a dizzy sensation.  However, rarely, tumors of the upper thorax can produce numbness/weakness of a limb as well as dizziness upon raising the arms. ",

      "body": "From your symptoms it appears that you are suffering from Orthostatic Hypotension \u2013 otherwise known as a \u201chead rush.\u201d  Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate.  The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting.  These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.    The most common causes of orthostatic hypotension can be divided into 3 catagories: Volume Depletion, Neurologic Abnormalities, and Medication.   Volume Depletion either from dehydration, anemia, or excessive fluid loss (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) can result in decreased intravascular volume and low blood pressure that can further be exacerbated by standing too fast.   Neurologic disorders can result in the inability of the body to constrict blood vessels in the leg as a person stands resulting in too much blood pooling in the legs and the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  Typically, this occurs in people with nerve damage, diabetes, dysautonomia, or other genetic/neurologic diseases.   Lastly, medications such as diuretics, antidepressants, or nerve blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension as part of their side effects.   It is not uncommon for people your age to suffer from orthostatic hypotension especially if you are in a growth spurt.  However, you should be evaluated by your primary doctor to see if there are any medical conditions contributing to your orthostatic hypotension. ",

      "body": "Post Polio Syndrome is a chronic condition that affects those infected with polio \u2013 often many years after the initial infection.  Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.  Researchers don\u2019t know the exact mechanism of the condition but believe it to be very slowly progressive in a step-wise fashion as patients generally experience years of latency followed by a gradual new onset muscle weakness and fatigue.  The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

In addition, you have a Triglyceride value of 122 which is desirable.  Each individual is different and the AHA recommended levels for cholesterol results are more like guidelines averaged over tens of thousands of patients.  In other words, your HDL level of 93 \u2013 an excellent number \u2013 appears to artificially inflates your total cholesterol number. I would focus more on the overall picture (HDL, LDL, triglycerides) than on one lab value (total cholesterol) as your cardiac risk is multifactorial.

Given that you are complaining of feet swelling when you stand or walk, this could be an underlying sign of cardiovascular problems such as heart failure.  Heart failure leads to poor circulatory effort and decreased venous return thereby leading to pooling of fluids in the lowest part of your body \u2013 your feet.  A similar problem arises with diabetes whereby the small vessels and nerves in your feet are damaged by high blood sugar and fluid pools in your feet causing swelling.  The itchiness and spots you are seeing could be a result of irritation due to this swelling. Dermatitis and insect bites can both cause inflammatory reactions in your feet causing swelling and itchiness.  Dermatitis results from contact with something that irritates your skin \u2013 the leather or dye on new sandals, nickel on toe rings, poison ivy, new detergent used to wash your socks, etc.  Insect bites such as mosquitoes, bed bugs, etc. can cause similar symptoms. Lastly fungal infections such as \u201cathletes foot\u201d can cause similar symptoms.  This is a fungal infection causing itching and blisters to develop as well as scaling and flaking of the affected areas.  Treatment can be with topical antifungals such as lotramin (available over the counter) or with prescription oral antifungals. If your feet have been progressively swelling, swollen for weeks, you have heart problems, you suspect a fungal infection, or you have diabetes, a visit to your primary care physician to evaluate the symptoms and proper control of your underlying condition would be warranted.  If you suspect dermatitis, remove the suspected irritant from your feet and treat with anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl.

      "body": "Isolated arm numbness can be benign or a symptom of an underlying decision.  That you are experiencing it in both your arms suggests a systemic or neurologic cause as opposed to local trauma.  However, common things being common, carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression are common causes of arm pain.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by repetitive wrist movements, such as typing, that cause stress to the tendons and nerves in the wrist.  Ulnar nerve compression is often caused by people who lean on their elbows or rest their forearms on the edge of their table.  This can result in arm pain and numbness that radiates from the forearm to the ring and little finger.\nWith local trauma ruled out, the likely culprits can be divided into endocrine diseases, neurologic diseases, cardiac/vascular disease, or vitamin deficiencies.\nRegarding endocrine diseases, diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy where your limbs become numb secondary to nerve death.  However, peripheral neuropathy usually starts affecting the lower extremities first.  Your doctor can screen for diabetes by measuring your blood sugar.\nNeurologic diseases such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathies, and spinal cord diseases can also cause bilateral arm pain.  The likely culprits can be ruled out with a neurologic exam supplemented with x-rays and/or MRI as well as blood tests for syphillis.\nArm pain can also be a sign of arterial insufficiency or cardiac problems such as angina where chest pain is often referred to the arm.\nFinally, as you mentioned that you get arm pain while drinking, vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and Thiamine can cause peripheral nerve problems.\nBecause your symptoms are increasing in frequency, a full medical workup is warranted by your medical doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause.

You\u2019ve fallen on some hard times over the last 12 months and recently have not been taking your medication. I counsel my patients to always remember to take care of themselves as well as taking care of others.  Good doctors will never belittle or insult their patients for not taking their medications but instead will find out why they have been forgetting to take the medications.

However, there are several indications for emergency dialysis: 1) Potassium elevation with EKG changes\n2) Toxic ingestion or overdose of drugs/toxins such as Lithium.\n3) Toxic uremia with evidence of bleeding disorders, pericarditis, cerebral edema.\n4) Fluid overload with unrefractory hypoxia ",

Alternatively, a low dose short acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam can also be used 1-2 hours before speaking in public.  If the public speaking and presentations are regular, patients often adapt and long term pharmacotherapy is usually not necessary.\nIn addition to pharmacotherapy, patients have also been shown to benefit from psychotherapy which involves addressing the underlying issues that cause the specific phobias.

Tension headaches occur in any age group but are most common among adolescents and adults.  These headaches are characterized by dull pressure in a tight band across the head often worst in the scalp, temples, back of neck, and shoulders.  The pain may be episodic, daily, weekly and last from 30 minutes to days. Tension headaches are believed to be muscular in origin and occur when the muscles in the scalp, temples, or neck contract or spasm \u2013 there is no structural brain abnormality.  Therefore, tension headaches can be caused by stress, anxiety, or head/neck trauma.  In your case, because of the distribution of pain, the tension headaches appear to be caused by your TMJ.  Other known triggers of tension headaches include: eye strain, dental problems (jaw clenching, teeth grinding), alcohol use, caffiene use, cold/flu, or sinus/ear infections. The first line of treatment is often with nonprescription NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen.  Relaxation techniques may also help decrease the headaches.  If NSAIDs and conservative treatment do not work, then second line treatments include: muscle relaxants or antidepressants (SSRIs or Tricyclics).  Headaches that worsen in nature, are associated with vision abnormalities, or induce nausea/vomiting are more serious in nature and require additional medical work up by a licensed professional.   In your case, it appears the headaches are being triggered by your TMJ and therefore you should explore options with your doctor to have that treated before exploring pharmacotherapy. ",

      "body": "For single tooth replacements, most dentists recommend implants over bridges.  Granted, this is quite subjective and based on personal experience and preference.  Implants have been around for over 30 years and in the hands of an experienced dentist, the success rates are over 99%.  Implants are superior to bridges for the following reasons:  1) Implants are independently seated and are not anchored to adjacent teeth.  Therefore there is no damaging of adjacent teeth as compared to the preparation for bridges. 2) Long term viability is very good to excellent with no need to replace an implant if it is properly cared for. 3) Although implants have a more expensive initial cost, it should be cheaper over the course of a lifetime compared to bridges.  Implants rarely require revision but bridges may require additional work as they rely on the integrity of anchor teeth. 4) Implant can be removed without damage to adjacent teeth. Whereas bridges were the standard of care in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, the field of implant dentistry has evolved.  As testament to the success of implants, most of my colleagues would opt for implants for themselves.  However, implants do carry disadvantages compared to bridges.  These include: 1) As a surgical procedure, implants carry all the risks associated with surgery including infection, nerve damage, poor wound healing, and even death.  Bridges don\u2019t carry this risk. 2) The process from tooth extraction to implant integration may take as long as 1 year.  3) Implants require more frequent follow-up (at least initially) compared to bridges.

Necrotizing fasciitis is suspected with a physical exam producing a crepitous sensation of the affected tissue (secondary to air pockets produced by the bacteria) and a radiographic evidence of air within the subcutaneous tissue. Necrotizing fasciitis is often caused by procedures that introduce bacteria from the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Typically, this includes breaks in the skin, injuries, insect bites, surgeries, injections, etc.  Diabetic patients and immunodeficient patients (HIV, cancer, etc.) are especially at risk because of a weakened immune system. As a survivor of necrotizing fasciitis, your risk of developing a re-infection is no greater than someone with your same risk factors who hasn\u2019t been previously infected.  Prevention of necrotizing fasciitis includes standard infection-prevention techniques such as proper sanitation, checking extremities for wounds (especially important for diabetics), proper glucose control, and avoid handling/eating undercooked or contaminated seafood or working with seawater/aquariums as it may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus \u2013 a bacteria associated with necrotizing fasciitis.

There are few proven methods to prevent facial sagging and these include botox injections as well as face/eye lifts.  Facial exercises, such as facial yoga may exercise specific facial muscles not normally used but you should only expect minimal results. It is important to note that one of the only proven non-surgical methods of decreasing facial lines/wrinkles are vitamin A derivatives.  Tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), also known as Retin-A, is currently the only topical agent FDA-approved for the treating of wrinkles and furrows caused by prolonged sun damage.

Other at-home therapies include itch-relief with antihistamines, thick emollient moisturizers \u2013 best applied within 3 minutes after a shower/bath, Vitamin D supplementation, and increasing omega 3 fatty acids in your diet.

Of the causes of local irritation, contact dermatitis must be ruled out.  You have changed your soap, lotion, and sheets.  However, other causes of irritation include allergies to the dye in your jeans, material of your pantyhose, allergies to the wax/shaving cream you use on your legs, etc. Certain systemic diseases can also lead to puriritis.  You should be evaluated by your physician for liver disease as a buildup of bilirubin can lead to itchiness.  Thyroid disease can also lead to pruritis.  In addition, renal failure can lead to pruritis as well. You should visit your physician or an allergist to determine the cause of your pruritis.  A physical exam and bloodwork are essential for diagnosing your condition. ",

      "body": "From your question it appears that you are suffering from acne vulgaris \u2013 a common skin disease affecting 70-80% of the world\u2019s population at some piont during their lives.  Acne vulgaris is characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules on the face, upper chest, and back.  However as you are past the age of puberty and your acne appeared three months ago when you first started taking birth control pills (oral contraceptives), it is very likely that your acne is being caused by these birth control pills. Birth control pills that contain high levels of synthetic progesterone analogs (especially older versions of birth control) are more prone to cause acne because they can mimic male puberty hormones.  The synthetic progesterone cause increase oil production in your sweat glands to induce acne formation on your face, upper chest, and back.  Therefore, it appears that the best way to treat your recent onset of acne would be to change your oral contraceptive pill to a formulation that has less progesterone or a newer version of synthetic progesterone. In fact, certain birth control pills haven been proven to improve acne in women.  These estrogen-progestin combination birth control pills have a newer version of synthetic progesterone that doesn\u2019t induce oil production and are actually approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat acne in women.  These pills include:\n-Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone (Estrostep)\n-Ethinyl estradiol / drospirenone (Yaz)\n-Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate (Ortho Tri-Cyclen) ",

      "body": "It appears that you are having a new onset of dry scaly patches of skin.  There are a number of possibilities for the etiology of the \u201cwhite/pinkish blotches of dry, flaky skin.\u201d.  On the top of the list includes dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, fungal infections, or vitamin deficiencies. Psoriasis is a common noncontagious disease of autoimmune etiology.  It is a result of an overgrowth of skin cells that result in plaques forming in discreet regions.  Nailbeds are frequently affected and nail damage is often a symptom.  Treatment is often with steroids or other immunomodulators. Eczema is thought to be an allergic reaction of the skin to external allergens.  It appears as dry, inflammed, and red patches of skin.  Like psoriasis, treatment is either with steroids and immunomodulators. Fungal infections such as ring worm can cause similar symptoms as you are describing.  Ring worm is caused by dermatophyte fungi \u2013 typically Tinea corporis and can arise in red, dry, circular lesions on the skin.  Usually, treatment is with a topical antifungal for 4-6 weeks can cure the fungal infection. Lastly vitamin deficiencies can cause dermatologic problems.  Specifically, deficiencies in vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, as well as zinc can all manifest in skin lesions. ",

      "body": "Itchy and swollen feet as you are describing can be a number of possibilities including but not limited to cardiovascular problems, diabetes, dermatitis, insect bites, or fungal infections. Given that you are complaining of feet swelling when you stand or walk, this could be an underlying sign of cardiovascular problems such as heart failure.  Heart failure leads to poor circulatory effort and decreased venous return thereby leading to pooling of fluids in the lowest part of your body \u2013 your feet.  A similar problem arises with diabetes whereby the small vessels and nerves in your feet are damaged by high blood sugar and fluid pools in your feet causing swelling.  The itchiness and spots you are seeing could be a result of irritation due to this swelling. Dermatitis and insect bites can both cause inflammatory reactions in your feet causing swelling and itchiness.  Dermatitis results from contact with something that irritates your skin \u2013 the leather or dye on new sandals, nickel on toe rings, poison ivy, new detergent used to wash your socks, etc.  Insect bites such as mosquitoes, bed bugs, etc. can cause similar symptoms. Lastly fungal infections such as \u201cathletes foot\u201d can cause similar symptoms.  This is a fungal infection causing itching and blisters to develop as well as scaling and flaking of the affected areas.  Treatment can be with topical antifungals such as lotramin (available over the counter) or with prescription oral antifungals. If your feet have been progressively swelling, swollen for weeks, you have heart problems, you suspect a fungal infection, or you have diabetes, a visit to your primary care physician to evaluate the symptoms and proper control of your underlying condition would be warranted.  If you suspect dermatitis, remove the suspected irritant from your feet and treat with anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl.  If other people in your family have similar swelling and itchiness, you suspect insect bites, anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl could be  ",

      "header": "Dear Doctors,  I have struggled with rosacea and associated inflammation/infection for 17 years. I hope the following  information regarding my symptoms and treatment will provide enough information to help with suggestions or recommendations about this condition.   At 16 I began developing inflamed red blotchy raised patches on my face. The rash originated on the sides of my chin and under my nose, and over time spread to my eyes and even into my nostrils. The rash was less inflamed in the mornings, but became increasingly inflamed as the day progressed.   The use of over the counter acne treatments (benzol peroxide products, astringents, etc.)  were ineffective and often further inflamed the rash. Following a year of unsuccessfully battling this condition, a family member offered me a tube of lotrizone.  The improvement was immediate. The rash disappeared in only a couple of days. The only problem; when I discontinued the cream, the condition quickly returned.   I did seek the help of the physician in our small town, but my doctor wasn\u2019t able to diagnose the condition, and continued to prescribe me lotrizone.   Two years later, I moved to a larger city, where I had the opportunity to visit a dermatologist. She instructed me to not use the cream for a week. Once the rash returned, she examined it and quickly diagnosed me with rosacea and an acne related infection. She prescribed 1000mg per day of tetracycline, and MetroGel for topical use.    The gel was harsh on my face and I only used it for a couple of days. However, the antibiotics worked and within a week of the month long antibiotic regiment, my skin had cleared.   Over the years, most often triggered by cold weather, the condition has flared, and a coarse of antibiotics is prescribed.   (A second dermatologist some years later, disagreed with the rosacea diagnosis, stating the condition was eczema. However, he prescribed the same treatment regimen of antibiotics / MetroGel. )  17 years later, I feel I\u2019m back at square one.  Over the last couple of years, the tetracycline has become ineffective, which is thought to be the result of having developing resistance to the medication. Doxycycline was prescribed, but due to an acute reaction, I had to discontinue use.  The antibitic \u2018Sulfa\u2019 was considered but rejected by my doctor due to dangerous side effects.   Following a recent visit to the MD, I am now taking a new class of antibiotic, (keflex \u2013 which was actually a recommendation made by a pharmacist following my severe reaction to the doxycycline ) and a Metro Cream instead of gel, which has proven less irritating to my skin. In addition to an oral antibiotic, the doctor suggested I mix a very small amount of lotrizone, (clotrimazole and betmethasone dipropionate Cream USP, 1%/0.5%) with the newly prescribed Metronidazole 0.75% and apply topically.   I \u2018initially\u2019 opted to not to mix the two, preferring to stop use of the topical steroid altogether. But after only two days of not using it, the inflammation returned, spread quickly, and my skin became sensitive to even the slightest touch.    Assuming both dermatologists were right, and I have a combination of rosacea and eczema, can you offer some suggestions and information about the following concerns/questions?   1. Is it possible my skin has become addicted to the lotrizone? 2. If so, how do I wean myself off without having major flare ups? Can using increasingly milder steroid creams be a reasonable method of achieving this, or is the mixture recommended by my current MD a suitable option?   3. Does the use of lotrizone inhibit the effectiveness of an oral antibiotic by hiding or suppressing the symptoms?  4. Is there a way to reinforce my skins strength in areas where the lotrizine is being applied to thwart thinning skin?  5. Could resistance to the appropriate class of antibiotics mean I may have to resort to long term topical steroid treatment?   Despite many years of  repeat flare-ups, varied creams, and month long cycles of antibiotics, I have been fortunate to have not sustained any real, or at least visible, skin damage. When free of flare-ups, my skin is quite healthy and clear.  And at 35, I realize my skin may not continue to be as resilient as it has been. In addition to help with the questions  posed, I would welcome any suggestions or guidance on how to manage this recurring condition in a way that minimizes the negatives, like further antibiotic resistance and skin damage.   Thank You.",
      "body": "Lotrisone is a cream or lotion containing a mixture of clotrimazole (an antifungal) and betamethasone (a steroid).  It appears from your question that you were given the cream version.  This formulation contains a medium to high corticosteroid potency.  From your question, it appears that your skin clears up with lotrisone NOT because of the antifungal properties but rather the steroid.  It is certainly a possibility that, over time, your skin has become acclimated to the steroids and once you stop using the cream, you experience a flare in your rosacea. Dermatologists often attempt a steroid taper to wean patients off high potency steroids.  High potency steroids can weaken the skin resulting in fragile, sensitive skin.  Tapers are usually performed over weeks to months for chronic steroid cream users like yourself.  A typical taper involves your current regimen for 1 week, followed by a lower potency steroid cream for 1 week, and then the lowest potency steroid for 1 week.  We aim to prescribe our patients the lowest dose of steroids that controls their symptoms and this is often creams containing hydrocortisone (low potency) as opposed to betamethasone (medium to high potency). Just cutting back on steroids doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the symptoms.  We have had success in patients with rosacea by having them mix in some gentle facial lotion, such as Eucerin, that don\u2019t clog their pores.  In addition, we highly recommend daily lotions that contain an SPF of 15 to prevent sun damage.  This can effectively increase skin strength and prevent further damage from your steroid cream.   ",

Tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), also known as Retin-A, is currently the only topical agent FDA-approved for the treating of wrinkles and furrows caused by prolonged sun damage.

Other antioxidants such as Vitamins (C and E), minerals (selenium), and biological proteins and lipids such as (coenzyme Q10 and alpha-lipoic acid) have also started appearing in creams.  Topically, these antioxidants are poorly absorbed and studies have not proven any long term efficacy in wrinkle reduction.

      "body": "The condition you are describing is consistent with balanitis which is an inflammation of the penile foreskin secondary to smegma formation and yeast or bacterial infection under the foreskin.   Balanitis is more prevalent in uncircumcised men and men with poor personal hygiene.  The penile discharges are accumulate under the foreskin which results in smegma formation and can lead to yeast or bacterial overgrowth.

In addition, topical antifungal medications are the primarily line of treatment with topical antibacterial medications used as a second line. Your prescription of Methasiazone cream is not effective in treating the most common infections associated with balanitis as it is an antiviral cream that has been used in the past to treat topical viral infections.  The proper treatment for yeast-type balanitis includes miconazole or clotrimazole.  The proper treatment for bacterial-type balanitis includes topical bacitraicin ointment.  I would clarify with whoever wrote you the prescription or gave you the methasiazone cream what they are exactly treating for.   Perhaps you have a case of genital herpes causing cracking of your foreskin in which case, oral antivirals such as acyclovir or penciclovir are the standard of care.

I am currently itching again and my hair on testicles have grown double what they were. what could cause this? From what you are describing, enlarged, burning, and itching with a bump on the inner side of the thigh sounds as if it could be local irritation to the skin caused by shaving and resulting in a dermatitis. Other common causes of your symptoms are folliculitis or a yeast infection.  Folliculitis is a bacterial overgrowth of the sweat/hair follicles of your skin.  Shaving can predispose you to folliculitis as it can cause ingrown hairs and trap bacteria in the follicles.  A yeast infection is also common in the groin area and can present with a similar pattern \u2013 treatment with an antifungal, such as diflucan, can be effective in curing your condition. Your symptoms are unlikely to be from herpes as the vesicles are exquisitely painful with a tingling/burning sensation prior to the development of vesicles. However, a form of chlamydia known as \u201clymphogranuloma venereum\u201d (LGV) can also present in a similar pattern.  LGV is caused by the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and invades the lymphatic system causing swelling and irritation.  Initial presentation may be a painless genital ulcer 1-2 weeks after innoculation of the bacterial which resolves within a few days.  After the primary stage heals, the secondary stage can occur weeks to months later with the infection spreading from the skin to the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes resulting in swelling/redness/tenderness (most often only on one side), in the groin or inner thigh.  The disease can be screened for with standard STD tests but rarely negative test results may require a biopsy of the affected area to visualize the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria.  Treatment with the proper antibiotics such as erythromycin or doxycycline can cure the infection and resolve the symptoms. And to address your final concern regarding your hairs growing back double \u2026 that doesn\u2019t appear to make medical sense. If your symptoms worsen or do no resolve with your current treatment regimen, you need to consult a licensed physician to evaluate you and determine the cause. ",

      "body": "Keloids are benign lesions that arise in scars because of an overgrowth of the scar tissue. These lesions can be quite large and can often cause pain if nerves are involved. Physicians can apply silicone gel on developing lesions to minimize pain and prevent growth of a keloid. Alternatively, injection of corticosteroids into the developing keloids can also be helpful. Up to 80% patients have a positive response to this treatment but keloids can often recur. Your treatment options depend on your symptoms and appearance of your scar. Therefore, proper medical evaluation is necessary prior to initiating treatment. ",

      "body": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease most often transmitted by the Ioxdes scapularis (otherwise known as the deer tick).  The risk of a tick-borne disease is negligible if the tick has not been attached.

If the tick is swollen with blood and attached for over 36 hours, then there is a 2% chance of transmission. There are two trains of though pertaining to Lyme disease.  Most physicians treat prophylactically with antibiotics (doxycycline), especially in high risk regions.  Some physicians tend to observe the patient and treat if any signs or symptoms of infection develop. Since you have bagged the tick, you should bring it to your physician for examination.  If your physician elects to wait and observe, then you should check your skin daily for erythema migrans \u2013 salmon colored rash with central clearing that is characterisitic of Lyme disease.  In addition, if you experience fevers, chills, facial droop, or other neurologic disorders, you should be evaluated immediately. ",

Exposure to mercury vapor can result in nerve damage.  For acute exposures of mercury, a blood mercury level is the most accurate test.

      "body": "From your symptoms it appears that you are suffering from Orthostatic Hypotension \u2013 otherwise known as a \u201chead rush.\u201d  Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate.  The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting.  These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.    The most common causes of orthostatic hypotension can be divided into 3 catagories: Volume Depletion, Neurologic Abnormalities, and Medication.   Volume Depletion either from dehydration, anemia, or excessive fluid loss (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) can result in decreased intravascular volume and low blood pressure that can further be exacerbated by standing too fast.   Neurologic disorders can result in the inability of the body to constrict blood vessels in the leg as a person stands resulting in too much blood pooling in the legs and the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  Typically, this occurs in people with nerve damage, diabetes, dysautonomia, or other genetic/neurologic diseases.   Lastly, medications such as diuretics, antidepressants, or nerve blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension as part of their side effects.   It is not uncommon for people your age to suffer from orthostatic hypotension especially if you are in a growth spurt.  However, you should be evaluated by your primary doctor to see if there are any medical conditions contributing to your orthostatic hypotension. ",

      "body": "There is a broad differential diagnosis for knee pain.  Important factors to consider is the onset, frequency, provocating factors, and intensity of the pain.  In addition, it is important to determine if the you have any history of trauma. Given you are 14 years old without any reports of trauma or additional symptoms (fever, other joint involvement, etc.), one of the most likely causes of your pain is Osgood-Schlatter Disease, otherwise known as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d  Osgood-Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in adolescents \u2013 estimated to affect up to 20%.  The symptoms include pain and swelling at the lateral-inferior side of the knee around the tibial tubercle (the bump below the knee cap on the right side of the right knee).  The disease is considered to be benign and is secondary to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution.  Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling.  But if pain and swelling persists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil) are prescribed to decrease the swelling and pain. As Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, acute and chronic pathologies should be ruled out by your primary care physician with a physical exam, X-ray imaging or MRI imaging. ",

Necrotizing fasciitis is suspected with a physical exam producing a crepitous sensation of the affected tissue (secondary to air pockets produced by the bacteria) and a radiographic evidence of air within the subcutaneous tissue. Necrotizing fasciitis is often caused by procedures that introduce bacteria from the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Typically, this includes breaks in the skin, injuries, insect bites, surgeries, injections, etc.  Diabetic patients and immunodeficient patients (HIV, cancer, etc.) are especially at risk because of a weakened immune system. As a survivor of necrotizing fasciitis, your risk of developing a re-infection is no greater than someone with your same risk factors who hasn\u2019t been previously infected.  Prevention of necrotizing fasciitis includes standard infection-prevention techniques such as proper sanitation, checking extremities for wounds (especially important for diabetics), proper glucose control, and avoid handling/eating undercooked or contaminated seafood or working with seawater/aquariums as it may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus \u2013 a bacteria associated with necrotizing fasciitis.

From what you are describing it appears as if you are suffering from the effects of a sinus infection. Sinuses are mucous membrane lined cavities within the bones of our face.  Normally sinuses produce mucous which drain into our nasal cavities and pharynx.  If the sinuses become clogged, bacteria can proliferate and cause an infection resulting in the symptoms of facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion/discharge, bad breath/taste, fever, headache, cough, etc. There is scant evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis and most doctors would advise against using antibiotics for routine cases of sinusitis.  The preferred method of treatment for sinusitis involves decreasing the sinus inflammation with nasal sprays such as Oxymetazoline (Afrin), oral decongestants such as Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). If your symptoms persist, you should be evaluated by a otolaryngologist (ENT) or have facial X-rays or a CT scan performed of your facial bones to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. ",

      "body": "A pancreatic cyst can certainly cause epigastric pain radiating to the back if it is associated with pancreatitis.  However, an isolated pancreatic cyst may just be an incidental finding.  Your GP should be able to inform you if you should be concerned about the cyst. A D-dimer test measures the amount of fibrin (protein found in blood clots) byproducts in the blood.  The test is ordered if there is a high suspicion of blood clots such as chest pain, leg pain, rapid heart rate, etc.  D-dimers are screening tests and it must be emphasized that a positive test result is NOT DIAGNOSTIC for a blood clot.  In fact, many other conditions can result in elevated D-dimers such as infections, inflammation, heart disease, or recent trauma.  In your case, the d-dimer may have been elevated by pancreatic inflammation but it is difficult to say as the cyst may just be incidental.   The best test to rule out a blood clot in the lung is the CT Angiogram (which it appears you had).  A negative result rules out a blood clot in the lung.  With your CT scan being negative, it is highly unlikely that you have a blood clot in your lung. ",

Concussions are known as \u201cMinor Traumatic Brain Injuries\u201d with the most common symptoms being confusion, headaches, dizziness, double vision, nausea, vomiting, mood changes, inability to concentrate and amnesia.  Most patients with concussions recover by day 3 and any recurring headaches often resolve by the 3rd week.

Much rarer are PCR tests for trichomonas which can detect the organisms proteins 84% of the time. Therefore, it is possible to have tested negative for trichomonas and still have it.

I\u2019ve gone to several doctors and neurologists and have tried all sorts of migraine medications with not much success. I have not had any tests run such as an MRI or CATSCAN.  I have kept a journal to try to find what may trigger these: food, lack of sleep, stress, caffeine, menstral cycle, etc. I have noticed that the symptoms are almost always the same.

The pain is always in my left eye brow, my left eye, behind my left eye, and bone of my left eye socket, and the top of both the bottom and top of my teeth (only on my left side). I also get nauseaus and vomit with them.   I am planning on going to a dentist now because I am thinking now that it may be TMJ.   I have been diagnosed with PCOS and anovulation.

Keeping a journal of triggers/activities is an excellent way to determine the cause of your migraines.  A CT scan may not be helpful but if your physician suspects an intracranial lesion, an MRI may be the best test.  Some women experience estrogen-withdrawal migraines when on birth control pills.  In addition, women who have PCOS have hormonal imbalances that affect their migraine threshold.  Lastly, your physician may elect to prescribe medication to help control your migraines such as  methysergide, beta blockers, valproic acid, etc. ",

      "body": "The symptoms you are describing are consistent with an ileus.  An ileus, also known as a bowel obstruction, is a disruption of the normal forward flow of the gastrointestinal tract.  An ileus can be mechanical or non-mechanical.  Symptoms often include excessive burping/belching, abdominal distension/discomfort, constipation, and lack of flatulence or bowel movements.   Causes can include episodes of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea that leave the bowel irritated.  Previous abdominal surgeries (appendectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy etc) can result in bowel adhesions that obstruct forward flow.  Ulcers can irritate the gastrointestinal tract decreasing motility.  Masses and tumors can mechanically obstruct the forward flow.  And neuropathies such as those associated with diabetes can damage gastrointestinal nerves and result in improper/absent motility.  If the symptoms have a clear provocation (such as gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and diarrhea) and resolve on their own without sequelae then no medical intervention is needed.  However, if these symptoms have been occurred before without an identifiable cause, you have a prior history of abdominal surgery, the symptoms do no improve, you are not passing gas, or you start vomiting, then prompt medical attention is needed.  Studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast can usually localize the site of the obstruction and identify any structural abnormality. ",

      "body": "It appears that you have suffered from statin induced myopathy secondary to your simvastatin.  Statins are commonly prescribed to to treat hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and have a relatively low rate of side effects.  The most common side effects are muscle myopathies which range from an asymptomatic rise in creatine phosphokinase (a byproduct of muscle breakdown) to mild myalgia (muscle pain) to rhabdomyalysis (rapid, fulminant muscle breakdown).  Muscular side effects can be expected in 10 to 15% of statin users. The prognosis varies depending on the condition: a patient who has suffered statin induced rhabdomyalysis \u2013 a rapid, fulminant destruction of muscle tissue \u2013 will have a much longer recovery time than a patient suffering from statin induced myalgia.  Diagnosis of rhabdomyalsis includes an elevation in creatine phosphokinase, elevation in potassium, deterioration of kidney function, dark urine, as well as extreme weakness and muscle pain.  From what you are describing, it appears that you have a statin induced myalgia.  The overall prognosis of this condition is extremely favorable as long as it is recognized and treated promptly.   The first line of treatment is to discontinue the statin.  Secondly, adequate hydration must be maintained to prevent any kidney damage.  Recent trials have shown vitamin D therapy, for those deficient in vitamin D, to be effective in treating and aiding recovery from statin induced myopathy.  There have been clinical trials of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in patients with statin myopathy but the results have been inconcusive and there is no evidence to support its use to treat statin induced myopathy. In my experience, elderly patients who have had statin induced myopathy take anywhere from 3 months to over a year after stopping statins to recover from the muscle aches.  The most important factor in these patient\u2019s recovery is to resume as much of their daily activities and exercise as they can tolerate.  Bedrest is not advised, especially in the elderly, as it will deteriorate their muscles even further and further compromise their strength. ",

The most concerning of these symptoms is the sudden weight loss which could be secondary to a serious medical condition.

One condition that comes to mind that involves both sudden onset weight loss and a sweet taste in the back of the mouth is diabetes.

Balanitis is more prevalent in uncircumcised men and men with poor personal hygiene.  The penile discharges are accumulate under the foreskin which results in smegma formation and can lead to yeast or bacterial overgrowth. The standard treatment for balanitis include daily retraction of the foreskin and washing the entire area with warm water and gentle soap.  Remember to replace the foreskin.  In addition, topical antifungal medications are the primarily line of treatment with topical antibacterial medications used as a second line. Your prescription of Methasiazone cream is not effective in treating the most common infections associated with balanitis as it is an antiviral cream that has been used in the past to treat topical viral infections.  The proper treatment for yeast-type balanitis includes miconazole or clotrimazole.  The proper treatment for bacterial-type balanitis includes topical bacitraicin ointment.  I would clarify with whoever wrote you the prescription or gave you the methasiazone cream what they are exactly treating for.   Perhaps you have a case of genital herpes causing cracking of your foreskin in which case, oral antivirals such as acyclovir or penciclovir are the standard of care.

Hemodialysis works by circulating blood outside the body through a filter.  Peritoneal Dialysis, on the other hand, takes place inside the body and uses the membrane in your abdominal cavity as a filter for the toxic metabolites, ions, and excess water. Usually, a person requires dialysis when kidney function is disturbed either acutely (acute renal failure) or chronically (chronic renal failure).  However, there are several indications for emergency dialysis: 1) Potassium elevation with EKG changes\n2) Toxic ingestion or overdose of drugs/toxins such as Lithium.\n3) Toxic uremia with evidence of bleeding disorders, pericarditis, cerebral edema.\n4) Fluid overload with unrefractory hypoxia ",

      "body": "The symptoms you are describing point to a neurologic cause.  The pain in the lower back radiating to the knee cap is more likely to be due to a pinched nerve or a herniated lumbar disc than a pulled muscle.   Since the pain is worsening, you should be evaluated by your primary care physician or a neurologist with a physical exam.  An X-ray can help determine if you have any boney abnormalities.  If the X-ray is inconclusive, then an MRI can be performed to determine if you have a herniated disk or any nerve impingement. ",

If there are trace amounts of protein and blood, then there is usually little concern. If there are high levels of blood and protein in the urine, then a repeat test may be needed to confirm the results.  Elevated blood and protein in the urine suggest injury, inflammation, or autoimmune destruction of the kidneys.  Injury to the kidneys can be secondary to trauma, hypertension, or diabetes.  Inflammatory reactions in the kidney can be secondary to bacterial infections (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) or amyloidosis.  Lastly, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, IgA nephropathy, or vasculitides. ",

The onset, duration, and frequency of hot flashes vary from woman to woman so there is no fixed number of hot flashes per day that is considered \u201cnormal.\u201d  Hot flashes can be triggered by environmental and dietary factors.  Patients should avoid warm environments, spicy foods, and consuming caffeine.  In addition, cigarette smoking and stress can also trigger hot flashes.  Hormone replacement therapy has been used to treat hot flashes but alternatives exist.  Evening of Primose oil has been used to treat menopausal symptoms but it may take weeks to months before effects are experienced.  Vitamin E supplementation has also been shown to decrease hot flashes.  Lastly, a diet rich in soy and low in red meat can decrease the frequency of hot flashes.

From your question, there is certainly a chance you can impregnate your wife naturally if the only issue is a deletion of a portion of the Y chromosome.  Depending on your exact type of Y chromosome deletion and the extent of deletion, you may have either no decreased chance of impregnating your wife or you may have have a 50% reduction in impregnating your wife.  In the former, you would have normal daughters but your sons would also likely carry your Y chromosome deletion.  In the latter, we are assuming that your Y chromosome deletion has no impact on your X chromosome but the Y chromosome is incompatible with life.  Therefore you can only have daughters as only your sperm with X chromosomes are viable.  The remaining 50% of your sperm containing the mutated Y chromosome is incompatible with life. ",

Early satiation and diarrhea are symptoms related to gastrointestinal pathology and can be do to something benign such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  Rarely, it can be an indication of gastrointestinal malignancy.  Since you are 54, a screening colonoscopy is indicated for someone your age.  If it turns out you do have irritable bowel syndrome, then taking fiber may help. More likely, your gastrointestinal symptoms are due to an excess of thyroid hormone in your body due to Synthroid.  Excess thyroid hormone will mimic the symptoms of hyperthryoidism such as rapid heart rate, diarrhea, excessive feelings of warmth, etc.  A simple blood test will tell you if your levels are appropriate.  Oftentimes, diet changes, changes in metabolism, or the addition of new medications can alter the metabolism of existing drugs such as Synthroid.

Proper hand-hygiene is also necessary to prevent ingesting contaminated materials. In addition, drugs such as Vermox (mebendazole) should be taken properly.  For pinworm infections, the pill must be chewed and then swallowed with a repeat dose in two weeks to kill any remaining larvae.  For whipworm, hookworm, or roundworm infections, you must chew one pill for 5 days and then repeat the drug course in 3-4 weeks to kill any remaining larvae.

      "body": "With a diagnosis of osteopenia, you have a decreased overall level of calcium in your body.  Your body requires calcium to regulate its nerves and if you have low calcium, your body will break down bones to release calcium.  Electrolyte abnormalities such hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch as the nerves become \u201ctwitchy\u201d without the calcium or magnesium to stabilize it. Given your osteopenia, calcium supplementation is indicated.  There are other drugs such as bisphosphonates that may increase bone density in those who are osteopenic.  You should discuss your options with your doctor as well as discuss options to relieve joint pain.  Taking steroids long term is extremely damaging to the body and taking high dose ibuprofen will make you at high risk for stomach ulcers.

      "body": "Hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of hypothyroidism is more often observed in women than men.  The most likely suspect in this situation is the thyroxine you are taking but it can also be a variety of other factors. In layman\u2019s terms, thyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone that is inactive until is broken down in the liver to produce active thyroid hormone T3.  The liver is also the source of triglycerides.  In some people, the process of breaking down thyroxine into T3 also releases triglycerides which may result in hypertriglyceridemia.  Other causes of hypertriglyceridemia include copper, calcium, or magnesium deficiencies, as well as estrogen therapy. Although a triglyceride level of 180 is not a desirable outcome, there is tremendous benefit in becoming euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone values).  However, you should follow your triglycerides and cholesterol closely and if they continue to rise, you may need to alter your medications.  ",

The onset, duration, and frequency of hot flashes vary from woman to woman so there is no fixed number of hot flashes per day that is considered \u201cnormal.\u201d  Hot flashes can be triggered by environmental and dietary factors.  Patients should avoid warm environments, spicy foods, and consuming caffeine.  In addition, cigarette smoking and stress can also trigger hot flashes.  Hormone replacement therapy has been used to treat hot flashes but alternatives exist.  Evening of Primose oil has been used to treat menopausal symptoms but it may take weeks to months before effects are experienced.  Vitamin E supplementation has also been shown to decrease hot flashes.  Lastly, a diet rich in soy and low in red meat can decrease the frequency of hot flashes. Lastly, your symptoms of \u201ca sick feeling in my stomache, my vision gets slightly blurred, my heart pounds rapidly, and I sweat terribly\u201d is also suspicious of heart arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytomas.  Therefore, you should be evaluated by your primary care physician for these symptoms. ",

For pinworm infections, the pill must be chewed and then swallowed with a repeat dose in two weeks to kill any remaining larvae.

Most patients do well with conservative management such as maintaining a healthy diet, adequate hydration, and abstinence from alcoholic beverages or liver-toxic drugs.

People fall into three categories with regards to gout:\n1) The majority of patients are unable to adequately excrete the uric acid in urine.\n2) Some patients over-consume food rich in uric acid (red meat, alcohol, etc.)\n3) Lastly, there are patients who produce excessive amounts of uric acid. Treatment for gout involves dietary modification as well as pharmacotherapy with the goal to lower uric acid so that patients do not get acute gouty attacks.  Patients should eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet as well as limit their intake of red meat and beer.  Pharmacotherpay is the mainstay for gout therapy with drugs such as allopurino, probenecid, and colchicine being the most common drugs used. If you are still having gouty attacks, you should be evaluated by your primary care physician or rheumatologist to determine if your blood uric acid levels are still too high despite pharmacotherapy and if modifying the drugs you are on could help.

Biting your tongue can cause a simple bruise to occur.  These can be painful but will resolve within a few days. If you have amalgam dental fillings, the lesion in your mouth could be an amalgam tattoos.  These lesions are often found in on the gums, cheek, tongue, palate, or lips of people with amalgam fillings and are a result of metal particles becoming embedded in the tissue of the mouth.  These lesions are benign but are permanent. Melanocytic nevi are \u201cmoles\u201d that occur in the mouth.  Only a biopsy can tell if the nevi are benign or if it is a rare melanoma of the oropharynx. Therefore, you should see your primary care physician or your dentist to have the area examined and determine if a biopsy is warranted. ",

Sea Kelp contains high levels of iodine and may be recommended by some practitioners of alternative medicine for \u201cthyroid support.\u201d  It is not commonly prescribed by medical doctors and most doctors discourage taking iodine supplementation for individuals without iodine deficiency.  In terms of the physiologic need for iodine, seas kelp supplementation would ONLY be necessary if the person is actually deficient in iodine. Although every individual is different, the vast majority of patients prescribed Synthroid have hypothyroidism that is unrelated to iodine deficiency.  Therefore, chances are, sea kelp supplementation would not be beneficial and it is highly recommended that you continue taking Synthroid.

However, other causes of irritation include allergies to the dye in your jeans, material of your pantyhose, allergies to the wax/shaving cream you use on your legs, etc. Certain systemic diseases can also lead to puriritis.  You should be evaluated by your physician for liver disease as a buildup of bilirubin can lead to itchiness.  Thyroid disease can also lead to pruritis.

I would like to know if what he is telling me is medically possible, or medically impossible, because it sounds very strange to me.

Though he was feeling fine, he went to the hospital as instructed.  At the hospital he was told that he had lost more than half his blood.  They gave him \u201c4 units\u201d.  Then they put a scope down his throat to see why he was bleeding.  They confirmed 6 bleeding ulcers.  They caulderized them and sent him home the next day.  When he went back to work 2 weeks later, they told him he needed the doctor to \u201cclear\u201d him for work before he could come back.  When he went to the doctor to get cleared, it was determined that he was still bleeding and that they now needed to do a cat scan to see why because the ulcers had been fixed.  A cat scan was taken.  When the results came back he was told that he had colon cancer and it was really bad, that it has spread outside the colon.  A couple of days later he went to get a colonoscopy.  At that time he told the doctor that over the last two weeks he was having severe pains in his abdomen.  The doctor told him that this type of cancer does not come with a lot of pain, so maybe he didn\u2019t have cancer after all\u2026 that maybe he had a ruptured appendix and what was actually on the cat scan was fluids from the ruptured appendix.  So the colonoscopy was cancelled because if they did that, then it could possibly kill him if he had a ruptured appendix.  He was given a 10-day prescription of antibiotics and an new appointment was scheduled for the colonoscopy in two weeks.  No additional tests or hospitalization was done at this point.  I was under the impression that a ruptured appendix would kill if not treated immediately by removal of the appendix, and I told him that.  He said that the doctor told him that it is possible, to survive a ruptured appendix.  So now he has me waiting two more weeks to see if he has colon cancer, or if he had a ruptured appendix.  This all sounds so crazy to me.

      "body": "From your symptoms it appears that you are suffering from Orthostatic Hypotension \u2013 otherwise known as a \u201chead rush.\u201d  Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate.  The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting.  These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.    The most common causes of orthostatic hypotension can be divided into 3 catagories: Volume Depletion, Neurologic Abnormalities, and Medication.   Volume Depletion either from dehydration, anemia, or excessive fluid loss (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) can result in decreased intravascular volume and low blood pressure that can further be exacerbated by standing too fast.   Neurologic disorders can result in the inability of the body to constrict blood vessels in the leg as a person stands resulting in too much blood pooling in the legs and the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  Typically, this occurs in people with nerve damage, diabetes, dysautonomia, or other genetic/neurologic diseases.   Lastly, medications such as diuretics, antidepressants, or nerve blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension as part of their side effects.   It is not uncommon for people your age to suffer from orthostatic hypotension especially if you are in a growth spurt.  However, you should be evaluated by your primary doctor to see if there are any medical conditions contributing to your orthostatic hypotension. ",

Atelectasis versus scarring is seen in the midaspect of the lung bases. There is a tiny, non calcified nodule in the left major fissure measuring 0.4 cm in diameter. That was directly from the resaults. Quite a few family members including aunts uncles and mother had blood clots in their lungs. As well my grandfather passed of lung cancer when I was about 12 years old. Is there any advice you can give me?

      "body": "It appears as if you have two major issues: family history of pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) and recurrent gastrointestinal pains. A family history of pulmonary emboli can mean there is either a family history of cancer or a genetic component that is causing the blood to be hypercoagulable (easier to form clots).  Cancer is one of the major causes blood thickening that results in clots in the veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and float to the lung.  Genetic causes for hypercoagulation are known to run in families.  Factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic causes of hypercoagulability occurring in 3-7% of the general population.  Other causes include Prothrombin 20210A, Lupus Anticoagulant, Protein C or S deficiency, etc.  These genetic diseases result in blood that clots more readily and can result in blood cloots in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and end up in the lung.  Blood tests can determine if you any clotting disorder \u2013 your d-dimer test appears to be normal given the clinical circumstance.  If your doctor suspect blood clots in the leg, a doppler study of the lower can visualize the veins. You second condition relates the the gastrointestinal tract.  Most common causes of abdominal pain in young females include ovulatory pains, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or food allergies (including lactose intolerance).  More rarer are diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn\u2019s disease.  Your gastrointestinal condition should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist who can properly test you for the conditions.  If you are indeed experiencing symptoms of diverticulitis (which is rare in someone of your age), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a colonoscopy to follow if there is suspicion of colonic pathology. In the end, if your doctor is blowing you off and does not seem interested in diagnosing your condition, it might be time to search for a new one. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you are having gastrointestinal issues which requires professional evaluation by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  With your symptoms three possible diagnoses come to mind: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction, or gallstones. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also known as acid reflux.  Patients suffer from constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus and often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation. Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping. Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. A hiatal hernia is a result of a portion of the stomach prolapsing up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.  Hiatal hernias cause patients to experience much of the same symptoms as GERD and may even contribute to GERD.  In addition, patients may report feeling full prematurely.  Most hiatal hernias do not require treatment.  However, surgery may be indicated in severe cases or if there are serious anatomic deformities resulting in inability to feed. Esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction is a broad spectrum of diseases that range from achalasia to autonomic dysfunction to diverticulae.  In short, the esophagus is unable to paralyzed (partially or completely) or there is a blind pouch in the esophagus and food becomes stuck leading the patient to feel as if something is stuck in their chest.  Treatments range from pharmacotherapy to surgery depending on the cause. Lastly, your burning and abdominal discomfort with eating may be related to gallstones (cholelithiasis) which produces painful colic in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Eating causes your gall bladder to contract and if there are stones present, it may cause a transient blockage of the gall bladder\u2019s sphincter.  The treatment is often with surgery to remove the gall bladder. In short, you should be evaluated by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  A physical exam is necessary to create a working differential diagnosis.  Tests such as pH monitoring, barium swallows, endoscopies, and right upper quandrant ultrasounds are especially helpful in diagnosing your condition. ",

It is estimated that over 50% of the world\u2019s population is colonized with the bacteria and although over 75% of them are asymptomatic, H. pylori is a known cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as stomach cancer. The mechanism behind H. pylori\u2019s disease process is its propensity to cause inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis).  This inflammation weakens the stomach and small intestine\u2019s mucous barrier which acts as a defense against acid corrosion.  Therefore, stomach and duodenal ulcers occur at areas where there are high concentrations of H. pylori. ",

      "body": "The formula for calculating the cholesterol values are as follows: Total Cholesterol = LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides/5) Normal lab values vary from institution to institution but the following values are generally accepted as normal:\nTotal Cholesterol\t< 200 mg/dl\nHDL cholesterol\t> 30 mg/dl\nLDL cholesterol\t65 \u2013 180 mg/dl\nTriglycerides\t45 \u2013 155 mg/dl In terms of your lab results, an LDL of 104 mg/dl is acceptable and an HDL of 93 is considered to be protective of cardiovascular disease.  In addition, you have a Triglyceride value of 122 which is desirable.  Each individual is different and the AHA recommended levels for cholesterol results are more like guidelines averaged over tens of thousands of patients.  In other words, your HDL level of 93 \u2013 an excellent number \u2013 appears to artificially inflates your total cholesterol number.

The condition is relatively common but more prevalent in females then males because women tend to have a smaller caliber tear duct.  There are numerous causes of duct obstruction and include trauma, local inflammation, infection, medical side effects, as well as neoplasm. Nasolacrimal duct obstructions should be treated promptly to avoid any long term problems.  A proper work-up includes an evaluation by a qualified physician or opthalmologist before initiating treatment.  Imaging studies can be performed such as a CT-scan or X-rays with dye injection to visualize the duct architecture.  Treatment ranges from conservative to surgical and depends on the severity of your symptoms.  Typically, a warm compress applied to the affected corner of the eye for 20 minutes five times a day can open up the duct in mild cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction.  Antibiotics either topical or systemic can treat bacterial infections.  Finally, if conservative measures fail, then surgical intervention would become necessary. ",

Patellofemoral syndrome is a result of a misalignment of the knee joint (most commonly with the knee cap or patella) resulting in the cartilage of femur or tibia rubbing against the knee cap and causing the creaking noise you hear.  Patellofemoral syndrome is often caused by past injuries, overuse of the knee, or poor alignment of the muscles/bones around the knee.  As the knee joints bear most of the weight, the condition is exacerbated in overweight individuals. To treatment focuses on limiting the wear and tear on your knees.

      "body": "Bad breath and pungent odors after getting sick are hallmark symptoms for sinus infections (sinusitis).  From what you are describing it appears as if you are suffering from the effects of a sinus infection. Sinuses are mucous membrane lined cavities within the bones of our face.  Normally sinuses produce mucous which drain into our nasal cavities and pharynx.  If the sinuses become clogged, bacteria can proliferate and cause an infection resulting in the symptoms of facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion/discharge, bad breath/taste, fever, headache, cough, etc. There is scant evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis and most doctors would advise against using antibiotics for routine cases of sinusitis.  The preferred method of treatment for sinusitis involves decreasing the sinus inflammation with nasal sprays such as Oxymetazoline (Afrin), oral decongestants such as Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). If your symptoms persist, you should be evaluated by a otolaryngologist (ENT) or have facial X-rays or a CT scan performed of your facial bones to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. ",

      "body": "Parasitic infections are exceedingly rare in industrialized nations and are mostly found in third world countries that lack clean water, sterile food, etc.  Therefore, if you reside in an industrialized nation, there is no clinical indication for prophylactic treatment of parasites. There are many classes of parasites.  For the purpose of your question, we will simplify them into: 1) those that infect the intestinal tract (round worms, tape worms, etc), 2) those that infect the blood (malaria), 3) those that infect the genitourinary tract (schistosomes and trichomonas), and 4) those that infect the brain (naegleria). For intestinal parasites, your doctor can run a simple stool test for ova and parasites if you experience symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, etc.  The treatment for most intestinal worm infections is one to two doses of albendazole or mebendazole. For infections of the blood with parasites such as malaria, your doctor can obtain a blood smear to look for malaria if you experience symptoms such as cyclical fevers.  Malaria can be prevented by prophylactic drugs prior to travel to an endemic area but can also be treated once contracted and is rarely deadly once treatment is initiated. Genitourinary infections with schistosomes would produce bloody urine and trichomonas a frothy discharge.  Both of these can be tested for by your doctor if you have symptoms and both are readily treatable. Infections by naegleria fowleri are exceedingly rare but also rapidly fatal.  These infections primary occur in people swimming in warm, freshwater lakes where the parasite invades the human via the nasal canal.  There are a few treatment regimens available (such as amphotericin B) but the majority of infections lead to death.  There is no prophylaxis for this parasite. In summary, there is no reason for prophylactic treatment of parasites for individual without risk factors or exposure.  If any symptoms arise, your doctor can readily test for parasites and offer the appropriate treatment.  Furthermore, there exists no one way to \u201ccleanse\u201d your body of parasites as each class of parasite affects different organisms and the treatment regimen is unique for each parasite.  And regarding those online \u201cdetoxes\u201d or \u201ccleanses\u201d that promises to rid your body of parasites, there does not appear to be any medical evidence or legitimacy to support those claims.

There earliest a pregnancy can be detected is about 10 days of conception with a blood test that your doctor can run in his office.

      "body": "The symptoms you are describing are consistent with an ileus.  An ileus, also known as a bowel obstruction, is a disruption of the normal forward flow of the gastrointestinal tract.  An ileus can be mechanical or non-mechanical.  Symptoms often include excessive burping/belching, abdominal distension/discomfort, constipation, and lack of flatulence or bowel movements.   Causes can include episodes of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea that leave the bowel irritated.  Previous abdominal surgeries (appendectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy etc) can result in bowel adhesions that obstruct forward flow.  Ulcers can irritate the gastrointestinal tract decreasing motility.  Masses and tumors can mechanically obstruct the forward flow.  And neuropathies such as those associated with diabetes can damage gastrointestinal nerves and result in improper/absent motility.  If the symptoms have a clear provocation (such as gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and diarrhea) and resolve on their own without sequelae then no medical intervention is needed.  However, if these symptoms have been occurred before without an identifiable cause, you have a prior history of abdominal surgery, the symptoms do no improve, you are not passing gas, or you start vomiting, then prompt medical attention is needed.  Studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast can usually localize the site of the obstruction and identify any structural abnormality. ",

Usually, a person requires dialysis when kidney function is disturbed either acutely (acute renal failure) or chronically (chronic renal failure).  However, there are several indications for emergency dialysis: 1) Potassium elevation with EKG changes\n2) Toxic ingestion or overdose of drugs/toxins such as Lithium.\n3) Toxic uremia with evidence of bleeding disorders, pericarditis, cerebral edema.\n4) Fluid overload with unrefractory hypoxia ",

In fact, these small (less than 5 mm) cysts are relatively common and found in over 25% of sampled cadavers.  These small pineal cysts rarely cause symptoms.  With your pineal cyst measuring 9 mm, it would be considered a large pineal cyst which may be associated with a variety of symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, and abnormal sleep/wake patterns.  These large cysts may also be associated with brain abnormalities such as seizures and migraines.  The symptoms of large cysts are mainly due to compression of adjacent structures. Surgery for pineal cysts are mainly indicated for patients who\u2019s symptoms are severely debilitating.

      "body": "Asbestos is considered to be benign as long as the material is not friable.  The United States EPA states that asbestos flooring in good condition is generally considered to be safe but the materials can become friable with age, or by sanding, grinding, or with demolition.  You would need to consult an licensed contractor that has experience working with asbestos tiles but in general, the Minnesota Department of Health has a great resource on residential removal of asbestos tiles: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/asbestos/floortile/index.html There is no amount of asbestos exposure that is considered to be safe.  Asbestos related diseases are dose-dependent with increased exposure resulting in a higher likelihood of disease \u2013 but not everyone gets sick.  In addition, the diseases have a latency period of 20-40 years from exposure to potential onset of disease.  Shipyard workers and construction workers with asbestos related diseases generally have been exposed high quantity of airborne asbestos for many years. In your case, removal of a basement full of asbestos containing tiles does not turn your home into a health hazard \u2013 especially if the tiles were in good shape and you didn\u2019t sand, grind, or demolish the stones.  While each person\u2019s susceptibility to disease is unique, there is a low chance of developing any asbestos related diseases from the minor construction you describe.   You should consult your family physician but from what you are describing, no medical testing is warranted at this time.

      "body": "It is common for periods to be delayed after pregnancy especially if you are still breast feeding or have recently stopped breast feeding.  Prolactin is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland in response to an infant\u2019s suckling and its primary purpose is to stimulate breast milk production.  As a side effect, prolactin inhibits sex hormones and is responsible for increasing irregularity or a complete loss of menstrual periods. Another factor that may be contributing to your loss of menstrual periods is the recent move from Dubai to India.  Stress is a major factor that can inhibit ovulation and menstruation. Given that your pregnancy tests have been negative, it is unlikely that you are pregnant.  In addition, you have had menstrual bleeding so a serious disorder with your pituitary gland is unlikely.

      "body": "Post Polio Syndrome is a chronic condition that affects those infected with polio \u2013 often many years after the initial infection.  Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.  Researchers don\u2019t know the exact mechanism of the condition but believe it to be very slowly progressive in a step-wise fashion as patients generally experience years of latency followed by a gradual new onset muscle weakness and fatigue.  The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

      "body": "There is a broad differential diagnosis for knee pain.  Important factors to consider is the onset, frequency, provocating factors, and intensity of the pain.  In addition, it is important to determine if the you have any history of trauma. Given you are 14 years old without any reports of trauma or additional symptoms (fever, other joint involvement, etc.), one of the most likely causes of your pain is Osgood-Schlatter Disease, otherwise known as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d  Osgood-Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in adolescents \u2013 estimated to affect up to 20%.  The symptoms include pain and swelling at the lateral-inferior side of the knee around the tibial tubercle (the bump below the knee cap on the right side of the right knee).  The disease is considered to be benign and is secondary to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution.  Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling.  But if pain and swelling persists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil) are prescribed to decrease the swelling and pain. As Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, acute and chronic pathologies should be ruled out by your primary care physician with a physical exam, X-ray imaging or MRI imaging. ",

      "body": "A pancreatic cyst can certainly cause epigastric pain radiating to the back if it is associated with pancreatitis.  However, an isolated pancreatic cyst may just be an incidental finding.  Your GP should be able to inform you if you should be concerned about the cyst. A D-dimer test measures the amount of fibrin (protein found in blood clots) byproducts in the blood.  The test is ordered if there is a high suspicion of blood clots such as chest pain, leg pain, rapid heart rate, etc.  D-dimers are screening tests and it must be emphasized that a positive test result is NOT DIAGNOSTIC for a blood clot.  In fact, many other conditions can result in elevated D-dimers such as infections, inflammation, heart disease, or recent trauma.  In your case, the d-dimer may have been elevated by pancreatic inflammation but it is difficult to say as the cyst may just be incidental.   The best test to rule out a blood clot in the lung is the CT Angiogram (which it appears you had).  A negative result rules out a blood clot in the lung.  With your CT scan being negative, it is highly unlikely that you have a blood clot in your lung. ",

Armour Thyroid is a porcine based thyroid hormone replacement used to treat hypothyroidism.  Thyroid medication and thyroid disorders can certainly affect your period.  In general, too much thyroid hormone can decrease the frequency of your periods or making your periods lighter. A deficit of thyroid hormone can lead to increased frequency of periods, heavier periods, and even an increase in the pain and discomfort of menstruation.  Dicontinuing thyroid hormone medication can certainly affect menstruation.  The affects are most likely temporary but it may take a few cycles before your periods normalize.

      "body": "Thyroid problems can indeed affect your menstrual period.  Hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) is the overproduction of thyroid hormones.  Hyperthyroidism can be asymptomatic but it can also affect your menstrual cycle by decreasing the frequency of your periods and making your periods lighter.  In severe cases, hyperthyroidism can cause menstruation to cease. Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) is the underproduction of thyroid hormones.  Hypothyroidism can also be asymptomatic but it can also affect your menstrual cycle by increasing the frequency of periods, causing heavy periods with increased or prolonged menstrual bleeding, or even increase the pain and discomfort of menstruation.  Since you\u2019ve already had a thyroid lobectomy and are on replacement thyroid hormone (Synthroid), you can suffer from both hyper and hypothyroidism based on your dosage of Synthroid.  There are many drugs and foods that can interact and increase or decrease the metabolism of the replacement thyroid hormone.  A simple blood test measuring your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels can determine if your Synthroid dose is adequate.  If not, your doctor can adjust your dosage accordingly. ",

      "body": "Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by uncontrollable and/or excessive perspiration.  Common areas affected are the face, axillary regions, palms, groin, and soles of the feet.  It is believed that hyperhidrosis is caused by an increased activity of sympathetic nerve fibers \u2013 the same nerves responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response when a person is stressed.  Spicey foods, caffeine, and nicotine can also trigger hyperhidrosis in susceptible individuals. There are a number of treatments available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Your doctor prescribed you topical aluminum chloride which is often the first line treatment.  Anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin, benztropine, or glycopyrrolate can also used for their inhibition of normal nerve responses which may reduce perspiration.  However, these drugs have numerous side effects that may make them less desirable. Anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines are often prescribed to patients who sweat due to anxiety.  From your question, it appears as if you sweat mainly during the day \u2013 which is when most social situations occur \u2013 and return to normal at night.  This treatment method might be best suited for your symptoms. A more invasive procedure include Botox injections which can temporarily paralyze the nerves that innervate the sweat glands but this requires a trained professional, is mainly used for axillary sweating, and the effects only last for a few months. There are two main surgical techniques used to treat hyperhidrosis.  Direct sweat gland removal is a surgical procedure whereby the cosmetic surgeon directly removes the sweat glands.  This technique is almost exclusively used for axillary hyperhidrosis.  Another surgical technique involves removing or disabling the sympathetic nerve ganglion \u2013 known as a sympathectomy.  Although this is one of the more effective procedures, it also has the most serious side effects including permanent paralysis of nerves of the face, neck, and arms. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you have two major issues: family history of pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) and recurrent gastrointestinal pains. A family history of pulmonary emboli can mean there is either a family history of cancer or a genetic component that is causing the blood to be hypercoagulable (easier to form clots).  Cancer is one of the major causes blood thickening that results in clots in the veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and float to the lung.  Genetic causes for hypercoagulation are known to run in families.  Factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic causes of hypercoagulability occurring in 3-7% of the general population.  Other causes include Prothrombin 20210A, Lupus Anticoagulant, Protein C or S deficiency, etc.  These genetic diseases result in blood that clots more readily and can result in blood cloots in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and end up in the lung.  Blood tests can determine if you any clotting disorder \u2013 your d-dimer test appears to be normal given the clinical circumstance.  If your doctor suspect blood clots in the leg, a doppler study of the lower can visualize the veins. You second condition relates the the gastrointestinal tract.  Most common causes of abdominal pain in young females include ovulatory pains, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or food allergies (including lactose intolerance).  More rarer are diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn\u2019s disease.  Your gastrointestinal condition should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist who can properly test you for the conditions.  If you are indeed experiencing symptoms of diverticulitis (which is rare in someone of your age), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a colonoscopy to follow if there is suspicion of colonic pathology. In the end, if your doctor is blowing you off and does not seem interested in diagnosing your condition, it might be time to search for a new one. ",

A 2003 article in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology studied 32,741 urine samples and isolated only 13 samples with Staphylococcus sciuri.  Of those 13 isolates, only one case of symptomatic urinary tract infection and five cases of asymptomatic bactiuria (greater than 100,000 colony forming units of the same species in a urine culture of a patient without symptoms) were established.  Therefore, the study concluded that Staphyloccoccus sciuri can be a pathogen: it is an extremely rare cause of urinary tract infection and can also cause asymptomatic bactiuria.

      "body": "It appears as if you are describing the symptom of hyperreflexia where patients twitch or have spastic tendencies especially when you are excited.   The numbness/tingling in your fingers is a normal physiologic reaction to excitement \u2013 some people are just more sensitive to it.  The explanation relates to the calcium balance.  When most people get excited, they tend to breathe faster causing them to excrete more CO2 from the blood.  This increases the pH of the blood making it more basic.  As your blood becomes more basic, the proteins in your blood develop a higher affinity to blood calcium and therefore decreases the amount of free calcium in the bood.  This in turn results in a pseudo-hypocalcium which most people experience as a tingling/twitching/numbness in the fingers, toes, or lips. Causes for hyperreflexia can also be due to drug side effects, electrolyte abnormalities or upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) disease. Drugs such as stimulants (some of the most common include those used to treat attention deficit disorder such as Ritalin) can cause hyperreflexia.  In addition, the side effects of certain classes of antipsychotic drugs can cause tremors. Electrolyte abnormalities such as true hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch.  Conversely, extremely high levels of calcium may also cause your muscles to twitch. Neurologic diseases such as those that cause upper motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (abbreviated ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), primary lateral sclerosis (abbreviated PLS), or pseudobulbar palsy.  Most of these diseases are progressive and the symptoms quite severe.  Therefore, with isolated finger numbness, it is unlikely you have these conditions. Although it is completely normal for you to feel numbness in your fingers when you are excited, it is more concerning if you have the numbness when not excited.  If the numbness persists or worsens, your primary doctor should perform a detailed physical exam as well as draw labs such as calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone levels.  If warranted a electromyogram may be performed to check the neuromuscular connections. ",

The sensitivity of for over the counter urine hCG pregnancy tests varies between 90-97%. Blood hcg tests are more sensitive at 97-99% and they can actually quantify the amount of hCG circulating in the blood.

      "body": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease most often transmitted by the Ioxdes scapularis (otherwise known as the deer tick).  The risk of a tick-borne disease is negligible if the tick has not been attached.  The risk is less than 1% if the tick has attached but has not been engorged with blood (swollen) and feeding for less than 36 hours.  If the tick is swollen with blood and attached for over 36 hours, then there is a 2% chance of transmission. There are two trains of though pertaining to Lyme disease.  Most physicians treat prophylactically with antibiotics (doxycycline), especially in high risk regions.  Some physicians tend to observe the patient and treat if any signs or symptoms of infection develop. Since you have bagged the tick, you should bring it to your physician for examination.  If your physician elects to wait and observe, then you should check your skin daily for erythema migrans \u2013 salmon colored rash with central clearing that is characterisitic of Lyme disease.  In addition, if you experience fevers, chills, facial droop, or other neurologic disorders, you should be evaluated immediately. ",

Some doctors believe there is an association between pectus excavatum and heart disorders but no link has been formally found.  No intervention is needed unless there is pulmonary or cardiac impairment. Lastly, pectus carinatum (also known as pigeon chest) is a deformity of the chest wall characterized by cartilage and boney overgrowth resulting in protrusion of the sterum and anterior aspect of the ribs.  Most cases are congential and either are observed at birth or are observed during puberty.

A CT scan of the head can determine if you have any injury to the brain or major blood vessels of the head.

Concussions are known as \u201cMinor Traumatic Brain Injuries\u201d with the most common symptoms being confusion, headaches, dizziness, double vision, nausea, vomiting, mood changes, inability to concentrate and amnesia.  Most patients with concussions recover by day 3 and any recurring headaches often resolve by the 3rd week.

      "body": "With your reported medical history of TMJ (Temporomandibular joint disorder) diagnosed two years ago, it is likely that you are experiencing tension headaches \u2013 one of the most common forms of headaches.  Tension headaches occur in any age group but are most common among adolescents and adults.  These headaches are characterized by dull pressure in a tight band across the head often worst in the scalp, temples, back of neck, and shoulders.  The pain may be episodic, daily, weekly and last from 30 minutes to days. Tension headaches are believed to be muscular in origin and occur when the muscles in the scalp, temples, or neck contract or spasm \u2013 there is no structural brain abnormality.  Therefore, tension headaches can be caused by stress, anxiety, or head/neck trauma.  In your case, because of the distribution of pain, the tension headaches appear to be caused by your TMJ.  Other known triggers of tension headaches include: eye strain, dental problems (jaw clenching, teeth grinding), alcohol use, caffiene use, cold/flu, or sinus/ear infections. The first line of treatment is often with nonprescription NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen.  Relaxation techniques may also help decrease the headaches.  If NSAIDs and conservative treatment do not work, then second line treatments include: muscle relaxants or antidepressants (SSRIs or Tricyclics).  Headaches that worsen in nature, are associated with vision abnormalities, or induce nausea/vomiting are more serious in nature and require additional medical work up by a licensed professional.   In your case, it appears the headaches are being triggered by your TMJ and therefore you should explore options with your doctor to have that treated before exploring pharmacotherapy. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you are having gastrointestinal issues which requires professional evaluation by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  With your symptoms three possible diagnoses come to mind: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction, or gallstones. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also known as acid reflux.  Patients suffer from constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus and often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation. Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping. Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. A hiatal hernia is a result of a portion of the stomach prolapsing up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.  Hiatal hernias cause patients to experience much of the same symptoms as GERD and may even contribute to GERD.  In addition, patients may report feeling full prematurely.  Most hiatal hernias do not require treatment.  However, surgery may be indicated in severe cases or if there are serious anatomic deformities resulting in inability to feed. Esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction is a broad spectrum of diseases that range from achalasia to autonomic dysfunction to diverticulae.  In short, the esophagus is unable to paralyzed (partially or completely) or there is a blind pouch in the esophagus and food becomes stuck leading the patient to feel as if something is stuck in their chest.  Treatments range from pharmacotherapy to surgery depending on the cause. Lastly, your burning and abdominal discomfort with eating may be related to gallstones (cholelithiasis) which produces painful colic in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Eating causes your gall bladder to contract and if there are stones present, it may cause a transient blockage of the gall bladder\u2019s sphincter.  The treatment is often with surgery to remove the gall bladder. In short, you should be evaluated by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  A physical exam is necessary to create a working differential diagnosis.  Tests such as pH monitoring, barium swallows, endoscopies, and right upper quandrant ultrasounds are especially helpful in diagnosing your condition. ",

      "body": "From your symptoms, it sounds as if you are suffering from chronic prostatitis but your urine cultures have been negative.  This can either indicate that you have either a chronic bacterial prostatitis or a chronic abacterial prostatitis.  To distinguish between the two, you will need to have your expressed prostatic secretions cultured (not just urine samples). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the diagnosis if the expressed prostatic secretions are positive for bacteria.  It has a reputation among urologists as being difficult to treat because of the persistence of bacteria within the prostate either because of poor drainage of prostatic fluids or reflux of urine into the prostate.  The standard treatments for bacterial prostatitis are fluoroquinolones like you mentioned such as Ciprofloxacin, Oxfloxacin, or Levofloxacin.  As an alternative Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is also prescribed twice a day for a four week course and may be especially effective in patients who experience side effects from the fluoroquinolones. Chronic abacterial prostatitis mimics the symptoms of chronic bacterial prostatitis except the expressed prostatic secretions are negative for bacteria.  In fact, the majority of chronic prostatitis \u2013 up to 90% of treated patients \u2013 are abacterial.  It is important to note a negative culture does not necessarily mean there are no organisms infecting the prostate but could indicate infection by a non-culturable organism such as chlamydia, trichomonas, gonorrhea, viruses, fungi, or other rare bacteria.  Autoimmune diseases and conditions can also cause abacterial prostatitis.  The initial treatment is either with a two week trial of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) or with a quinolone.  However, your urologist might add other drugs such as Flomax or finasteride to your treatment regimen. In your case, the proper algorithm to follow four weeks of unsuccessful antibiotics is a repeat expressed prostatic secretion analysis.  At this time, your urologist might elect to either perform more tests, put you on a full course of antibiotics, or put you on additional drugs if he determines that you have abacterial prostatitis.  I would keep the appointment with your urologist and if you are concerned about antibiotics, give him/her a call to ask for advice. ",

Elevated blood and protein in the urine suggest injury, inflammation, or autoimmune destruction of the kidneys.  Injury to the kidneys can be secondary to trauma, hypertension, or diabetes.  Inflammatory reactions in the kidney can be secondary to bacterial infections (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) or amyloidosis.

There are a number of possibilities for the etiology of the \u201cwhite/pinkish blotches of dry, flaky skin.\u201d.

Treatment is often with steroids or other immunomodulators. Eczema is thought to be an allergic reaction of the skin to external allergens.  It appears as dry, inflammed, and red patches of skin.  Like psoriasis, treatment is either with steroids and immunomodulators. Fungal infections such as ring worm can cause similar symptoms as you are describing.  Ring worm is caused by dermatophyte fungi \u2013 typically Tinea corporis and can arise in red, dry, circular lesions on the skin.  Usually, treatment is with a topical antifungal for 4-6 weeks can cure the fungal infection. Lastly vitamin deficiencies can cause dermatologic problems.

      "body": "Aching, tingling, numbness, and itching in the arms and hands can be benign or a symptom of an underlying disorder. These symptoms can suggest a systemic or neurologic cause. Carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression are common causes of arm pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by repetitive wrist movements, such as typing, that cause stress to the tendons and nerves in the wrist. Ulnar nerve compression is often caused by people who lean on their elbows or rest their forearms on the edge of their table. This can result in arm pain and numbness that radiates from the forearm to the ring and little finger. With local trauma ruled out, the likely culprits can be divided into endocrine diseases, neurologic diseases, cardiac/vascular disease, or vitamin deficiencies.\nRegarding endocrine diseases, diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy where your limbs become numb secondary to nerve death. However, peripheral neuropathy usually starts affecting the lower extremities first. Your doctor can screen for diabetes by measuring your blood sugar. Neurologic diseases such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathies, and spinal cord diseases can also cause bilateral arm pain. The likely culprits can be ruled out with a neurologic exam supplemented with x-rays and/or MRI as well as blood tests for syphillis. Arm aches, tingling, numbness, and itching can also be a sign of arterial insufficiency or cardiac problems such as angina where chest pain is often referred to the arm. Finally, vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and Thiamine can cause peripheral nerve problems. As the aching, tingling, numbness, and itching in your arm could be a sign of a serious medical condition, a full medical workup is warranted by your doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause.

      "body": "MRSA is otherwise known as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.  The bacteria is believed to have evolved resistance to the first few generations of antibiotics and is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections \u2013 especially in the immunocompromised or elderly.   People can have MRSA colonization or MRSA infections.  MRSA colonization is a result of having MRSA growing on your skin, nasal cavities, etc. without it causing the patient any undue stress \u2013 this is not an active infection.  A MRSA infection on the other hand is characterized by fever, chills, cough, sometimes pustules and pimples.  MRSA infections are life threatening and can potentially kill patients if untreated. It appears from your question that you are colonized with MRSA and are having sores appear under your arms.  To address the sores under your arms, one recommendation patients have found helpful is to avoid the use of antiperspirants and instead use only deodorants.  Antiperspirants can increase the chance of sores under your arms by preventing you from sweating and clogging your pores where bacteria can grow. MRSA rarely spreads and colonizes the blood in healthy patients \u2013 usually that occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, the very young, or the elderly.  Treatment for MRSA is now usually with vancomycin in those patients who require oral or IV antibiotics. The standard precautions to prevent spread of MRSA to others include standard hygiene techniques such as washing hands, covering your mouth when sneezing, cleaning surfaces and bathrooms and especially avoiding contact with infants, the elderly, or the immunocompromised.  Precautions differ based on your colonization status so you should check with your doctor. Signs that you have a serious infection include fever, chills, fatigue, etc.  Either way, you should be evaluated by your main doctor to see how bad your infection is and treatment options based on your infection status.

Electrolyte abnormalities such hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch as the nerves become \u201ctwitchy\u201d without the calcium or magnesium to stabilize it. Given your osteopenia, calcium supplementation is indicated.  There are other drugs such as bisphosphonates that may increase bone density in those who are osteopenic.

For whipworm, hookworm, or roundworm infections, you must chew one pill for 5 days and then repeat the drug course in 3-4 weeks to kill any remaining larvae. Lastly, if these methods fail to control your worm infection, you should be evaluated for immunodeficiency.   ",

      "body": "Hot flashes occur in over 75% of all menopausal women lasting anywhere for a few months to over a decade.  The onset, duration, and frequency of hot flashes vary from woman to woman so there is no fixed number of hot flashes per day that is considered \u201cnormal.\u201d  Hot flashes can be triggered by environmental and dietary factors.  Patients should avoid warm environments, spicy foods, and consuming caffeine.  In addition, cigarette smoking and stress can also trigger hot flashes.  Hormone replacement therapy has been used to treat hot flashes but alternatives exist.  Evening of Primose oil has been used to treat menopausal symptoms but it may take weeks to months before effects are experienced.  Vitamin E supplementation has also been shown to decrease hot flashes.  Lastly, a diet rich in soy and low in red meat can decrease the frequency of hot flashes. Lastly, your symptoms of \u201ca sick feeling in my stomache, my vision gets slightly blurred, my heart pounds rapidly, and I sweat terribly\u201d is also suspicious of heart arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytomas.

      "body": "Your symptoms can either be attributed to a gastrointestinal issue or to your thyroid medication.  Early satiation and diarrhea are symptoms related to gastrointestinal pathology and can be do to something benign such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  Rarely, it can be an indication of gastrointestinal malignancy.  Since you are 54, a screening colonoscopy is indicated for someone your age.  If it turns out you do have irritable bowel syndrome, then taking fiber may help. More likely, your gastrointestinal symptoms are due to an excess of thyroid hormone in your body due to Synthroid.  Excess thyroid hormone will mimic the symptoms of hyperthryoidism such as rapid heart rate, diarrhea, excessive feelings of warmth, etc.  A simple blood test will tell you if your levels are appropriate.  Oftentimes, diet changes, changes in metabolism, or the addition of new medications can alter the metabolism of existing drugs such as Synthroid.  Therefore, you should also return to the doctor who prescribed your Synthroid and be evaluated for your symptoms there and if need-be, have your medication adjusted. ",

Additional symptoms such as hot flashes, loss of libido, fatigue, and irritability would all point to the diagnosis of menopause.  The average age for menopause in modern women is approximately 50-52 years. By definition, a woman is menopausal if she has no menses for a period of 12 months and all other medical reasons have been excluded.  It is unlikely that birth control pills are contributing to your diminished periods unless you have recently changed pills.  Undergoing menopause at the age of 38 is not uncommon especially if there is a family history of early menopause (if your mother, aunts, sisters, grandmothers all had early menopause, then it is likely you will undergo early menopause).  However, you should be evaluated for medical causes of your decreasing periods.  Hormone levels fluctuate daily based on a variety of factors; they are a poor indicator of menopause and should not be used to diagnose menopause.  However, an ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial lining is often performed for anovulatory (not ovulating) women around the age of menopause or post-menopausal who are still having vaginal spotting or continuous vaginal bleeding.

It functions by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain by prevent their re-uptake in neurotransmitter junctions.  Concerta has a number of side effects, some of which affect the brain and are serious. Although memory problems are not a known side effect of Concerta, patients who experience hallucinations should seek immediate medical attention from their primary care physician, psychiatrist, or the primary prescriber of the medication as it could be a sign of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Your reported history of memory disturbances, decreased concentration, bizarre lucid dreams, and decreased sleep is suspicious for an underlying psychiatric disorder such as bipolar disorder or possibly schizophrenia.

      "body": "It appears that you have suffered from statin induced myopathy secondary to your simvastatin.  Statins are commonly prescribed to to treat hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and have a relatively low rate of side effects.  The most common side effects are muscle myopathies which range from an asymptomatic rise in creatine phosphokinase (a byproduct of muscle breakdown) to mild myalgia (muscle pain) to rhabdomyalysis (rapid, fulminant muscle breakdown).  Muscular side effects can be expected in 10 to 15% of statin users. The prognosis varies depending on the condition: a patient who has suffered statin induced rhabdomyalysis \u2013 a rapid, fulminant destruction of muscle tissue \u2013 will have a much longer recovery time than a patient suffering from statin induced myalgia.  Diagnosis of rhabdomyalsis includes an elevation in creatine phosphokinase, elevation in potassium, deterioration of kidney function, dark urine, as well as extreme weakness and muscle pain.  From what you are describing, it appears that you have a statin induced myalgia.  The overall prognosis of this condition is extremely favorable as long as it is recognized and treated promptly.   The first line of treatment is to discontinue the statin.  Secondly, adequate hydration must be maintained to prevent any kidney damage.  Recent trials have shown vitamin D therapy, for those deficient in vitamin D, to be effective in treating and aiding recovery from statin induced myopathy.  There have been clinical trials of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in patients with statin myopathy but the results have been inconcusive and there is no evidence to support its use to treat statin induced myopathy. In my experience, elderly patients who have had statin induced myopathy take anywhere from 3 months to over a year after stopping statins to recover from the muscle aches.  The most important factor in these patient\u2019s recovery is to resume as much of their daily activities and exercise as they can tolerate.  Bedrest is not advised, especially in the elderly, as it will deteriorate their muscles even further and further compromise their strength. ",

The United States EPA states that asbestos flooring in good condition is generally considered to be safe but the materials can become friable with age, or by sanding, grinding, or with demolition.  You would need to consult an licensed contractor that has experience working with asbestos tiles but in general, the Minnesota Department of Health has a great resource on residential removal of asbestos tiles: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/asbestos/floortile/index.html There is no amount of asbestos exposure that is considered to be safe.  Asbestos related diseases are dose-dependent with increased exposure resulting in a higher likelihood of disease \u2013 but not everyone gets sick.  In addition, the diseases have a latency period of 20-40 years from exposure to potential onset of disease.  Shipyard workers and construction workers with asbestos related diseases generally have been exposed high quantity of airborne asbestos for many years. In your case, removal of a basement full of asbestos containing tiles does not turn your home into a health hazard \u2013 especially if the tiles were in good shape and you didn\u2019t sand, grind, or demolish the stones.  While each person\u2019s susceptibility to disease is unique, there is a low chance of developing any asbestos related diseases from the minor construction you describe.   You should consult your family physician but from what you are describing, no medical testing is warranted at this time.

I however had absolutely no physical or noticible symptoms.  Over the past year I have had 3 blood tests since my baseline was obtained and dosage chaged from 50 to 75 to 88 to 75mcmg.

The most likely suspect in this situation is the thyroxine you are taking but it can also be a variety of other factors. In layman\u2019s terms, thyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone that is inactive until is broken down in the liver to produce active thyroid hormone T3.  The liver is also the source of triglycerides.  In some people, the process of breaking down thyroxine into T3 also releases triglycerides which may result in hypertriglyceridemia.  Other causes of hypertriglyceridemia include copper, calcium, or magnesium deficiencies, as well as estrogen therapy. Although a triglyceride level of 180 is not a desirable outcome, there is tremendous benefit in becoming euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone values).  However, you should follow your triglycerides and cholesterol closely and if they continue to rise, you may need to alter your medications.  ",

      "body": "The symptoms you are describing \u2013 burning sensation throughout the day in your hands and feet \u2013 appear to be either neurologic in nature or due to medication reaction with your phentermine.  Some people have adverse reactions when quitting smoking, but quitting smoking in itself has not been known to cause a burning sensation.  A burning sensation in the hands and feet could be an indication for a neuropathy.  Diabetic neuropathy, a result of uncontrolled blood sugar, will damage the nerves in the hands and feet and cause an intense burning.  This disorder is common among diabetics and can be screened for with blood glucose tests or hemoglobin A1C tests.  Other causes of burning sensations include vitamin A, B complex, and E deficiencies.  In addition, patients suffering from anxiety have also reported symptoms of \u201cburning\u201d in their limbs. Medication interactions, especially with phentermine, can occur and cause these symptoms.  A reaction known as \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d can occur when one takes certain antidepressants with phentermine and results in warmth/flushing, increased body temperature, fast heart rate, nausea, vomiting, or psychomotor agitation. These symptoms you are experiencing warrant a physical exam and blood tests by your primary care physician to evaluate the cause, especially since they have been occurring for about a week.

      "body": "From what you are describing, it appears that you had an HIV ELISA test at an institution where they pricked your finger and sampled the blood directly from your finger with a micropipette instead of a capillary tube.  While technically improper, if the finger was properly sterilized and the lancet as well as the micropipette tip were both new and sterile, this does not put you at an elevated risk for contracting blood borne diseases such as HIV.  Micropipettes are set to draw up a specific volume into their tips.  When handled properly, no fluid should ever touch the micropipette itself \u2013 only the tip.  Therefore when the tip is disposed, any contaminant is eliminated as well.  Their technique, although unorthodox, does not appear to cross contaminate blood from one test subject to another from what you are describing. HIV tests are not performed on whole blood because the virus resides in the serum.  It is standard practice for blood taken from a patient to be spun in a centrifuge so the cells can be eliminated and the serum sampled for the test.  One can speculate that the person taking your blood with the micropipette ran the HIV ELISA test directly on the blood.  If this is the case, then there is a higher chance of a false negative (a person with HIV tests negative for HIV).  However, from what you are describing, there is no way of knowing if the institution spun the blood and performed the test on the serum or if they performed the test directly on the blood.  If this is an accredited institution for running HIV tests, then there is no reason not to trust the results of your exam. ",

      "body": "It sounds like you are having neuropathic pain affecting the left arm from the axilla to the fingers.  Seeing how you have had surgery on your neck, that appears to be the most likely culprit of your pain.  Based on your history, it is likely that your pain is caused by nerve impingement at the level of your cervical spine (the area of the spinal cord that\u2019s located in your neck). The location of your pain in relationship to your arm can localize the specific nerves that are impinged.  If your arm is numb around the area of your upper shoulder to your outer bicep and down to your thumb, it suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 5th or 6th cervical vertebrae.  Numbness affecting the back of your shoulder to the back of your elbow and down to your index and middle fingers suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 7th cervical vertebrae.  Finally, numbness at the area of your triceps to your ring and pinky finger suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 8th cervical vertebrae or 1st thoracic vertebrae.  The information regarding where your pain is exactly located is important for your doctor to determine which level of your spinal cord is affected. If the pain is mild and there is no associated weakness in the arm, then pharmacotherapy with neurologic drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin) have been found to be very effective in controlling neuropathic pain.  Muscle relaxants have also been used with varied results.   If the pain is persistently moderate to severe, worsening, or associated with muscle weakness, then a detailed medical evaluation by your primary care physicial, a neurologist, or a spine specialist (orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon) with associated imaging such as an MRI of the cervical spine is warranted.  These symptoms suggest a serious problem which may result in serious, irreversible nerve damage and surgery might be indicated. ",

Can you please help me to solve it out?",
      "body": "Phlegm in the back of the throat is often a symptom of an underlying condition.  The most common causes of phlegm in the back of the throat include post nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and environmental exposure. Post nasal drip is a condition with excessive mucus production by the nasal mucosa which accumulates in the back of the nose or the throat.  Patients often report symptoms such as constant swallowing, frequent spitting, difficulty breathing, and coughing.  Post nasal drip is often caused by allergic rhinitis but it can also be caused by sinusitis or GERD.  Treatment includes antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, antibiotics for sinusitis, and proton pump inhibitors for GERD. GERD, also known as acid reflux, is a disease characterized by constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.  Patients often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation.  Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping.  Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. Lastly, environmental exposure can cause excessive phlegm production.  Smoking or second hand smoke is one of the most common cause of phlegm.  Other irritants or allergens such as pollen, mold, fumes, pet dander, etc. can also cause an increased production in phlegm.  Treatment involves identifying and eliminating the source. In your case, the likely culprits from your excessive phlegm include allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, gastric reflux, or an environmental exposure.  An evaluation by your doctor to identify possible causes of your phlegm production would include a physical exam and careful history.  If appropriate, antibiotics to treat an underlying infection, antihistamines to treat post nasal drip, or a trial of proton pump inhibitors to treat GERD might be indicated.   ",

      "body": "It appears that you have overflow incontinence associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy.  The initial treatment of choice is alpha-adrenergic antagonists such as Flomax (tamsulosin) that act by relaxing smooth muscles around the bladder neck to help increase urine flow. Saw palmetto is a herbal drug extracted from the saw palmetto fruit.  It has been used for centuries in herbal and alternative medical practices.  It has been believed to be effective in treating gynecologic and urologic issues such as menstrual discomfort and infertility in women as well as reduce the incontinence associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy. However, saw palmetto has not been scientifically proven to improve urinary flow.  In a 2006 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 225 men over the age of 49 years who had moderate-to-severe symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated with saw palmetto extract (160 mg twice a day) or placebo.  The authors found that there was no significant difference between the saw palmetto and placebo groups in the change in maximal urinary flow rate, prostate size, residual volume after voiding, quality of life, or serum prostate-specific antigen levels during the one-year study.

I am currently itching again and my hair on testicles have grown double what they were. what could cause this? From what you are describing, enlarged, burning, and itching with a bump on the inner side of the thigh sounds as if it could be local irritation to the skin caused by shaving and resulting in a dermatitis. Other common causes of your symptoms are folliculitis or a yeast infection.  Folliculitis is a bacterial overgrowth of the sweat/hair follicles of your skin.  Shaving can predispose you to folliculitis as it can cause ingrown hairs and trap bacteria in the follicles.  A yeast infection is also common in the groin area and can present with a similar pattern \u2013 treatment with an antifungal, such as diflucan, can be effective in curing your condition. Your symptoms are unlikely to be from herpes as the vesicles are exquisitely painful with a tingling/burning sensation prior to the development of vesicles. However, a form of chlamydia known as \u201clymphogranuloma venereum\u201d (LGV) can also present in a similar pattern.  LGV is caused by the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and invades the lymphatic system causing swelling and irritation.  Initial presentation may be a painless genital ulcer 1-2 weeks after innoculation of the bacterial which resolves within a few days.  After the primary stage heals, the secondary stage can occur weeks to months later with the infection spreading from the skin to the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes resulting in swelling/redness/tenderness (most often only on one side), in the groin or inner thigh.  The disease can be screened for with standard STD tests but rarely negative test results may require a biopsy of the affected area to visualize the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria.  Treatment with the proper antibiotics such as erythromycin or doxycycline can cure the infection and resolve the symptoms. And to address your final concern regarding your hairs growing back double \u2026 that doesn\u2019t appear to make medical sense. If your symptoms worsen or do no resolve with your current treatment regimen, you need to consult a licensed physician to evaluate you and determine the cause. ",

      "body": "The condition you are describing is consistent with balanitis which is an inflammation of the penile foreskin secondary to smegma formation and yeast or bacterial infection under the foreskin.   Balanitis is more prevalent in uncircumcised men and men with poor personal hygiene.  The penile discharges are accumulate under the foreskin which results in smegma formation and can lead to yeast or bacterial overgrowth. The standard treatment for balanitis include daily retraction of the foreskin and washing the entire area with warm water and gentle soap.  Remember to replace the foreskin.  In addition, topical antifungal medications are the primarily line of treatment with topical antibacterial medications used as a second line. Your prescription of Methasiazone cream is not effective in treating the most common infections associated with balanitis as it is an antiviral cream that has been used in the past to treat topical viral infections.  The proper treatment for yeast-type balanitis includes miconazole or clotrimazole.  The proper treatment for bacterial-type balanitis includes topical bacitraicin ointment.  I would clarify with whoever wrote you the prescription or gave you the methasiazone cream what they are exactly treating for.   Perhaps you have a case of genital herpes causing cracking of your foreskin in which case, oral antivirals such as acyclovir or penciclovir are the standard of care. Whatever the case, visiting your primary care physician for clarification of your medication, diagnosis of your condition, and possible referral to a urologist for evaluation would be warranted ",

If an underlying cause can be detected by your primary care physician then (s)he can treat the cause.  However, if the diagnosis remains unsolved, then referral to a neurologist or ENT doctor may be pursued for further evaluation. For nerve damage causing tinnitus, some patients have found niacin supplementation to be helpful in reducing tinnitus.  Others have reported positive effects by taking gabapentin (neurontin).

The nerve damage is initially temporary but may become permanent if the blood sugar levels are not well controlled.  Peripheral nerve damage often results in numbness, tingling, burning pain, and lack sensation. The mainstay for treating diabetic neuropathy is with tight glucose control to prevent worsening of the symptoms.  In addition, medication can be prescribed to treat the symptoms such as pain and numbness.  Your primary care physician will be able to review your blood tests and prescribe the optimal medications to control your diabetes and your symptoms. ",

Sea Kelp contains high levels of iodine and may be recommended by some practitioners of alternative medicine for \u201cthyroid support.\u201d  It is not commonly prescribed by medical doctors and most doctors discourage taking iodine supplementation for individuals without iodine deficiency.  In terms of the physiologic need for iodine, seas kelp supplementation would ONLY be necessary if the person is actually deficient in iodine. Although every individual is different, the vast majority of patients prescribed Synthroid have hypothyroidism that is unrelated to iodine deficiency.  Therefore, chances are, sea kelp supplementation would not be beneficial and it is highly recommended that you continue taking Synthroid.

A meniscal tear is a common injury occurring in athletes in which does not necessarily produce a popping or tearing sensation and the pain is typical of that injury.  Nerve entrapments at the knee may also contribute to the pain.  Lastly, microfractures of the tibia (shin splints) can cause leg pain but this typically occurs in anterior aspect of the leg. For minor injuries, typical treatment requires 4-6 weeks of rest and NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) before gradually resuming low impact exercises (using an elliptical machine or swimming) while the injury heals \u2013 the stress of running or dancing can further exacerbate minor injuries.  Typically, patients presenting with your symptoms would be given conservative treatment regimens such as described above.  As the source of your problem appears to be at the area of the knee or ankle, a physical exam would be warranted to determine the cause of your problem if it persists or worsens despite conservative treatment.

Nearly all cases of gout are chronic conditions that the patient will need to manage for the rest of his/her life.

People fall into three categories with regards to gout:\n1) The majority of patients are unable to adequately excrete the uric acid in urine.\n2) Some patients over-consume food rich in uric acid (red meat, alcohol, etc.)\n3) Lastly, there are patients who produce excessive amounts of uric acid. Treatment for gout involves dietary modification as well as pharmacotherapy with the goal to lower uric acid so that patients do not get acute gouty attacks.  Patients should eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet as well as limit their intake of red meat and beer.  Pharmacotherpay is the mainstay for gout therapy with drugs such as allopurino, probenecid, and colchicine being the most common drugs used. If you are still having gouty attacks, you should be evaluated by your primary care physician or rheumatologist to determine if your blood uric acid levels are still too high despite pharmacotherapy and if modifying the drugs you are on could help.

The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting.  These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.    The most common causes of orthostatic hypotension can be divided into 3 catagories: Volume Depletion, Neurologic Abnormalities, and Medication.   Volume Depletion either from dehydration, anemia, or excessive fluid loss (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) can result in decreased intravascular volume and low blood pressure that can further be exacerbated by standing too fast.   Neurologic disorders can result in the inability of the body to constrict blood vessels in the leg as a person stands resulting in too much blood pooling in the legs and the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  Typically, this occurs in people with nerve damage, diabetes, dysautonomia, or other genetic/neurologic diseases.   Lastly, medications such as diuretics, antidepressants, or nerve blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension as part of their side effects.   It is not uncommon for people your age to suffer from orthostatic hypotension especially if you are in a growth spurt.  However, you should be evaluated by your primary doctor to see if there are any medical conditions contributing to your orthostatic hypotension. ",

      "body": "It appears that you have hypothyroidism which requires you to take Synthroid (a synthetic thyroid hormone).  The majority of the time in developed countries, hypothyroidism is caused by autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.  Rarely, hypothyroidism can be caused by iodine deficiency \u2013 but this is extremely uncommon in developed countries as the salt is usually fortified with iodine. Sea Kelp contains high levels of iodine and may be recommended by some practitioners of alternative medicine for \u201cthyroid support.\u201d  In terms of the physiologic need for iodine, seas kelp supplementation would ONLY be necessary if the person is actually deficient in iodine.  In most other cases, Sea Kelp supplementation would have no effect or even a potentially adverse effect. Although every individual is different, the vast majority of patients prescribed Synthroid have hypothyroidism that is unrelated to iodine deficiency.  Therefore, chances are, sea kelp supplementation would not be beneficial and you should continue taking Synthroid.  If you do decided to take sea kelp, you should first consult the doctor who prescribed your Synthroid to determine if iodine supplementation is beneficial or safe. ",

      "body": "Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading anaerobic bacterial infection involving deep fascial planes and resulting in rapid irreversible necrosis of tissues.  Necrotizing fasciitis is suspected with a physical exam producing a crepitous sensation of the affected tissue (secondary to air pockets produced by the bacteria) and a radiographic evidence of air within the subcutaneous tissue. Necrotizing fasciitis is often caused by procedures that introduce bacteria from the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Typically, this includes breaks in the skin, injuries, insect bites, surgeries, injections, etc.  Diabetic patients and immunodeficient patients (HIV, cancer, etc.) are especially at risk because of a weakened immune system. As a survivor of necrotizing fasciitis, your risk of developing a re-infection is no greater than someone with your same risk factors who hasn\u2019t been previously infected.  Prevention of necrotizing fasciitis includes standard infection-prevention techniques such as proper sanitation, checking extremities for wounds (especially important for diabetics), proper glucose control, and avoid handling/eating undercooked or contaminated seafood or working with seawater/aquariums as it may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus \u2013 a bacteria associated with necrotizing fasciitis.

      "body": "The formula for calculating the cholesterol values are as follows: Total Cholesterol = LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides/5) Normal lab values vary from institution to institution but the following values are generally accepted as normal:\nTotal Cholesterol\t< 200 mg/dl\nHDL cholesterol\t> 30 mg/dl\nLDL cholesterol\t65 \u2013 180 mg/dl\nTriglycerides\t45 \u2013 155 mg/dl In terms of your lab results, an LDL of 104 mg/dl is acceptable and an HDL of 93 is considered to be protective of cardiovascular disease.  In addition, you have a Triglyceride value of 122 which is desirable.  Each individual is different and the AHA recommended levels for cholesterol results are more like guidelines averaged over tens of thousands of patients.  In other words, your HDL level of 93 \u2013 an excellent number \u2013 appears to artificially inflates your total cholesterol number. I would focus more on the overall picture (HDL, LDL, triglycerides) than on one lab value (total cholesterol) as your cardiac risk is multifactorial.

The mechanism behind H. pylori\u2019s disease process is its propensity to cause inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis).  This inflammation weakens the stomach and small intestine\u2019s mucous barrier which acts as a defense against acid corrosion.  Therefore, stomach and duodenal ulcers occur at areas where there are high concentrations of H. pylori. ",

From what you are describing it appears as if you are suffering from the effects of a sinus infection. Sinuses are mucous membrane lined cavities within the bones of our face.  Normally sinuses produce mucous which drain into our nasal cavities and pharynx.  If the sinuses become clogged, bacteria can proliferate and cause an infection resulting in the symptoms of facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion/discharge, bad breath/taste, fever, headache, cough, etc. There is scant evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis and most doctors would advise against using antibiotics for routine cases of sinusitis.  The preferred method of treatment for sinusitis involves decreasing the sinus inflammation with nasal sprays such as Oxymetazoline (Afrin), oral decongestants such as Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). If your symptoms persist, you should be evaluated by a otolaryngologist (ENT) or have facial X-rays or a CT scan performed of your facial bones to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. ",

      "body": "Given your history, the creaking knees appear to be a sign of bone misalignment resulting in cartilage wear known as patellofemoral syndrome.  If untreated, there can be excessive degeneration of cartilage between bones of the knee joints resulting in pain and swelling (chondromalacia) and eventually osteoarthritis.   Patellofemoral syndrome is a result of a misalignment of the knee joint (most commonly with the knee cap or patella) resulting in the cartilage of femur or tibia rubbing against the knee cap and causing the creaking noise you hear.  Patellofemoral syndrome is often caused by past injuries, overuse of the knee, or poor alignment of the muscles/bones around the knee.  As the knee joints bear most of the weight, the condition is exacerbated in overweight individuals. To treatment focuses on limiting the wear and tear on your knees.  You should decrease high-impact exercises and increase low impact exercises that are lighter on your knees.  Running on concrete, asphalt, or a treadmill can damage your knees so try using an elliptical, swimming, or doing yoga.  In addition, you should also look into supportive and adequately cushioned footwear that can lessen the impact transmitted to your knee.   ",

Prolactin is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland in response to an infant\u2019s suckling and its primary purpose is to stimulate breast milk production.  As a side effect, prolactin inhibits sex hormones and is responsible for increasing irregularity or a complete loss of menstrual periods. Another factor that may be contributing to your loss of menstrual periods is the recent move from Dubai to India.  Stress is a major factor that can inhibit ovulation and menstruation. Given that your pregnancy tests have been negative, it is unlikely that you are pregnant.  In addition, you have had menstrual bleeding so a serious disorder with your pituitary gland is unlikely.

Physicians can apply silicone gel on developing lesions to minimize pain and prevent growth of a keloid. Alternatively, injection of corticosteroids into the developing keloids can also be helpful. Up to 80% patients have a positive response to this treatment but keloids can often recur. Your treatment options depend on your symptoms and appearance of your scar. Therefore, proper medical evaluation is necessary prior to initiating treatment. ",

      "body": "There is a broad differential diagnosis for knee pain.  Important factors to consider is the onset, frequency, provocating factors, and intensity of the pain.  In addition, it is important to determine if the you have any history of trauma. Given you are 14 years old without any reports of trauma or additional symptoms (fever, other joint involvement, etc.), one of the most likely causes of your pain is Osgood-Schlatter Disease, otherwise known as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d  Osgood-Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in adolescents \u2013 estimated to affect up to 20%.  The symptoms include pain and swelling at the lateral-inferior side of the knee around the tibial tubercle (the bump below the knee cap on the right side of the right knee).  The disease is considered to be benign and is secondary to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution.  Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling.  But if pain and swelling persists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil) are prescribed to decrease the swelling and pain. As Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, acute and chronic pathologies should be ruled out by your primary care physician with a physical exam, X-ray imaging or MRI imaging. ",

I was due to get my period about 2 days ago, and have not gotten it yet. Is it possible that discontinuing thyroid medication can effect menstrual cycle? If so, when should I expect to get my period? Armour Thyroid is a porcine based thyroid hormone replacement used to treat hypothyroidism.  Thyroid medication and thyroid disorders can certainly affect your period.  In general, too much thyroid hormone can decrease the frequency of your periods or making your periods lighter. A deficit of thyroid hormone can lead to increased frequency of periods, heavier periods, and even an increase in the pain and discomfort of menstruation.  Dicontinuing thyroid hormone medication can certainly affect menstruation.  The affects are most likely temporary but it may take a few cycles before your periods normalize.  Meanwhile, the most common cause of missed period is pregnancy, therefore a pregnancy test is warranted if you have been sexually active. ",

      "body": "Post Polio Syndrome is a chronic condition that affects those infected with polio \u2013 often many years after the initial infection.  Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.  Researchers don\u2019t know the exact mechanism of the condition but believe it to be very slowly progressive in a step-wise fashion as patients generally experience years of latency followed by a gradual new onset muscle weakness and fatigue.  The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

Without the proper tests, it is difficult to say, but your reported history of a dropping blood pressure after onset of symptoms suggest that you are experiencing a parasympathetic dysautonomia.   In other words, it appears as if your parasympathetic nervous system is overwhelming your sympathetic nervous system.  These parasympathetic signals cause your body\u2019s blood vessels to dilate which manifests as a low blood pressure as your peripheral arteries dilate and intense headache as your intracranial vessels dilate as well.

But this is my Mom History when we are little. After my younger brother born. 3-4 months later they go in the hospital to check my Mom health condition. According to the Doctor she have a tumor in his spinal column. The Doctor said it really needs surgery. 2 weeks after the surgery done. They go home.The Doctor said 3-6 months my Mom will be walking. And then my Mom stayed at home. She said to me while she at home she dont really have any Physical Therapy to help her. Except her Sister she help to exercise her legs sometimes. That  is really big different because there is no Proffessional Therapist help my Mom that time. We dont have money. I was to small then  4 years old. I cant remember what is really happened to my Mom. My older sister she is 11 years old. She is the one taking care of me, as well as my 6 years old brother.Thats why untill now still hoping, If my mom have the chance to walk again.  My youngest brother is 24 years old. Thats the time she starts cant walk after my younger brother born. Its starts in year 1987- up to this year 2011. She is in the wheelchair now. As i mentioned in my first question. If i try to pinch her both legs it start jumping. she still feel a sensation if i touch her legs. By the way my Mom lived in the Philippines right now.

      "body": "A pancreatic cyst can certainly cause epigastric pain radiating to the back if it is associated with pancreatitis.  However, an isolated pancreatic cyst may just be an incidental finding.  Your GP should be able to inform you if you should be concerned about the cyst. A D-dimer test measures the amount of fibrin (protein found in blood clots) byproducts in the blood.  The test is ordered if there is a high suspicion of blood clots such as chest pain, leg pain, rapid heart rate, etc.  D-dimers are screening tests and it must be emphasized that a positive test result is NOT DIAGNOSTIC for a blood clot.  In fact, many other conditions can result in elevated D-dimers such as infections, inflammation, heart disease, or recent trauma.  In your case, the d-dimer may have been elevated by pancreatic inflammation but it is difficult to say as the cyst may just be incidental.   The best test to rule out a blood clot in the lung is the CT Angiogram (which it appears you had).  A negative result rules out a blood clot in the lung.  With your CT scan being negative, it is highly unlikely that you have a blood clot in your lung. ",

You will need a physical exam focusing on your head as well as your eyes. The doctor will need to check if you have any blurry vision, blind spots,and if your eyes have full ranges of motion. A head CT will tellthe doctorsif there is any bleeding around your brain. In addition, a CT scan of your sinuses will be needed to evaluate the integrity of your facial bones (there may be damage as you described bruising under your eyes). Finally, if there is any damage to the bones around your eyes or if your eye exam is abnormal, an opthalmology consult would be needed to further evaluate your vision. ",

      "body": "Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by uncontrollable and/or excessive perspiration.  Common areas affected are the face, axillary regions, palms, groin, and soles of the feet.  It is believed that hyperhidrosis is caused by an increased activity of sympathetic nerve fibers \u2013 the same nerves responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response when a person is stressed.  Spicey foods, caffeine, and nicotine can also trigger hyperhidrosis in susceptible individuals. There are a number of treatments available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Your doctor prescribed you topical aluminum chloride which is often the first line treatment.  Anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin, benztropine, or glycopyrrolate can also used for their inhibition of normal nerve responses which may reduce perspiration.  However, these drugs have numerous side effects that may make them less desirable. Anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines are often prescribed to patients who sweat due to anxiety.  From your question, it appears as if you sweat mainly during the day \u2013 which is when most social situations occur \u2013 and return to normal at night.  This treatment method might be best suited for your symptoms. A more invasive procedure include Botox injections which can temporarily paralyze the nerves that innervate the sweat glands but this requires a trained professional, is mainly used for axillary sweating, and the effects only last for a few months. There are two main surgical techniques used to treat hyperhidrosis.  Direct sweat gland removal is a surgical procedure whereby the cosmetic surgeon directly removes the sweat glands.  This technique is almost exclusively used for axillary hyperhidrosis.  Another surgical technique involves removing or disabling the sympathetic nerve ganglion \u2013 known as a sympathectomy.  Although this is one of the more effective procedures, it also has the most serious side effects including permanent paralysis of nerves of the face, neck, and arms. ",

However, certain stressors such as excessive exercise or dieting can decrease the frequency of your periods and even stop them altogether. Urine or blood hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) tests are routinely ordered 10 or more days after a missed period. The sensitivity of for over the counter urine hCG pregnancy tests varies between 90-97%. Blood hcg tests are more sensitive at 97-99% and they can actually quantify the amount of hCG circulating in the blood. Depending on the test, levels between 20 to 100 mIU/ml of hCG is considered positive for pregnancy.  Since you are on birth control \u2013 which is unlikely to have any effect on the pregnancy test \u2013 if you have had 3 negative pregnancy tests at least 10 days after your missed period, it is unlikely that you are pregnant.

Of those 13 isolates, only one case of symptomatic urinary tract infection and five cases of asymptomatic bactiuria (greater than 100,000 colony forming units of the same species in a urine culture of a patient without symptoms) were established.  Therefore, the study concluded that Staphyloccoccus sciuri can be a pathogen: it is an extremely rare cause of urinary tract infection and can also cause asymptomatic bactiuria.

      "body": "It appears as if you are describing the symptom of hyperreflexia where patients twitch or have spastic tendencies especially when you are excited.   The numbness/tingling in your fingers is a normal physiologic reaction to excitement \u2013 some people are just more sensitive to it.  The explanation relates to the calcium balance.  When most people get excited, they tend to breathe faster causing them to excrete more CO2 from the blood.  This increases the pH of the blood making it more basic.  As your blood becomes more basic, the proteins in your blood develop a higher affinity to blood calcium and therefore decreases the amount of free calcium in the bood.  This in turn results in a pseudo-hypocalcium which most people experience as a tingling/twitching/numbness in the fingers, toes, or lips. Causes for hyperreflexia can also be due to drug side effects, electrolyte abnormalities or upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) disease. Drugs such as stimulants (some of the most common include those used to treat attention deficit disorder such as Ritalin) can cause hyperreflexia.  In addition, the side effects of certain classes of antipsychotic drugs can cause tremors. Electrolyte abnormalities such as true hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch.  Conversely, extremely high levels of calcium may also cause your muscles to twitch. Neurologic diseases such as those that cause upper motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (abbreviated ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), primary lateral sclerosis (abbreviated PLS), or pseudobulbar palsy.  Most of these diseases are progressive and the symptoms quite severe.  Therefore, with isolated finger numbness, it is unlikely you have these conditions. Although it is completely normal for you to feel numbness in your fingers when you are excited, it is more concerning if you have the numbness when not excited.  If the numbness persists or worsens, your primary doctor should perform a detailed physical exam as well as draw labs such as calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone levels.  If warranted a electromyogram may be performed to check the neuromuscular connections. ",

After attempts to diagnose the cause, the first line treatment for bruxism is often with dental guards at night.

      "body": "It appears as if you have two major issues: family history of pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) and recurrent gastrointestinal pains. A family history of pulmonary emboli can mean there is either a family history of cancer or a genetic component that is causing the blood to be hypercoagulable (easier to form clots).  Cancer is one of the major causes blood thickening that results in clots in the veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and float to the lung.  Genetic causes for hypercoagulation are known to run in families.  Factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic causes of hypercoagulability occurring in 3-7% of the general population.  Other causes include Prothrombin 20210A, Lupus Anticoagulant, Protein C or S deficiency, etc.  These genetic diseases result in blood that clots more readily and can result in blood cloots in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and end up in the lung.  Blood tests can determine if you any clotting disorder \u2013 your d-dimer test appears to be normal given the clinical circumstance.  If your doctor suspect blood clots in the leg, a doppler study of the lower can visualize the veins. You second condition relates the the gastrointestinal tract.  Most common causes of abdominal pain in young females include ovulatory pains, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or food allergies (including lactose intolerance).  More rarer are diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn\u2019s disease.  Your gastrointestinal condition should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist who can properly test you for the conditions.  If you are indeed experiencing symptoms of diverticulitis (which is rare in someone of your age), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a colonoscopy to follow if there is suspicion of colonic pathology.

      "body": "It appears as if you are having gastrointestinal issues which requires professional evaluation by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  With your symptoms three possible diagnoses come to mind: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction, or gallstones. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also known as acid reflux.  Patients suffer from constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus and often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation. Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping. Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. A hiatal hernia is a result of a portion of the stomach prolapsing up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.  Hiatal hernias cause patients to experience much of the same symptoms as GERD and may even contribute to GERD.  In addition, patients may report feeling full prematurely.  Most hiatal hernias do not require treatment.  However, surgery may be indicated in severe cases or if there are serious anatomic deformities resulting in inability to feed. Esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction is a broad spectrum of diseases that range from achalasia to autonomic dysfunction to diverticulae.  In short, the esophagus is unable to paralyzed (partially or completely) or there is a blind pouch in the esophagus and food becomes stuck leading the patient to feel as if something is stuck in their chest.  Treatments range from pharmacotherapy to surgery depending on the cause. Lastly, your burning and abdominal discomfort with eating may be related to gallstones (cholelithiasis) which produces painful colic in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Eating causes your gall bladder to contract and if there are stones present, it may cause a transient blockage of the gall bladder\u2019s sphincter.  The treatment is often with surgery to remove the gall bladder. In short, you should be evaluated by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  A physical exam is necessary to create a working differential diagnosis.  Tests such as pH monitoring, barium swallows, endoscopies, and right upper quandrant ultrasounds are especially helpful in diagnosing your condition. ",

The first pill should be started within five days of the beginning of the menstrual cycle to be at maximum effectiveness.  If the first pill is started at any other time, then seven consecutive days of pill use is needed. If your periods have been regular up to now, then then there may be a chance of pregnancy.  However, certain stressors such as excessive exercise or dieting can decrease the frequency of your periods.  In addition certain drugs may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.

With your pineal cyst measuring 9 mm, it would be considered a large pineal cyst which may be associated with a variety of symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, and abnormal sleep/wake patterns.  These large cysts may also be associated with brain abnormalities such as seizures and migraines.  The symptoms of large cysts are mainly due to compression of adjacent structures. Surgery for pineal cysts are mainly indicated for patients who\u2019s symptoms are severely debilitating.

      "body": "Post Polio Syndrome is a chronic condition that affects those infected with polio \u2013 often many years after the initial infection.  Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.  Researchers don\u2019t know the exact mechanism of the condition but believe it to be very slowly progressive in a step-wise fashion as patients generally experience years of latency followed by a gradual new onset muscle weakness and fatigue.  The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

      "body": "It appears as if you are describing the symptom of hyperreflexia where patients twitch or have spastic tendencies especially when you are excited.   The numbness/tingling in your fingers is a normal physiologic reaction to excitement \u2013 some people are just more sensitive to it.  The explanation relates to the calcium balance.  When most people get excited, they tend to breathe faster causing them to excrete more CO2 from the blood.  This increases the pH of the blood making it more basic.  As your blood becomes more basic, the proteins in your blood develop a higher affinity to blood calcium and therefore decreases the amount of free calcium in the bood.  This in turn results in a pseudo-hypocalcium which most people experience as a tingling/twitching/numbness in the fingers, toes, or lips. Causes for hyperreflexia can also be due to drug side effects, electrolyte abnormalities or upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) disease. Drugs such as stimulants (some of the most common include those used to treat attention deficit disorder such as Ritalin) can cause hyperreflexia.  In addition, the side effects of certain classes of antipsychotic drugs can cause tremors. Electrolyte abnormalities such as true hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch.  Conversely, extremely high levels of calcium may also cause your muscles to twitch. Neurologic diseases such as those that cause upper motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (abbreviated ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), primary lateral sclerosis (abbreviated PLS), or pseudobulbar palsy.  Most of these diseases are progressive and the symptoms quite severe.  Therefore, with isolated finger numbness, it is unlikely you have these conditions. Although it is completely normal for you to feel numbness in your fingers when you are excited, it is more concerning if you have the numbness when not excited.  If the numbness persists or worsens, your primary doctor should perform a detailed physical exam as well as draw labs such as calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone levels.  If warranted a electromyogram may be performed to check the neuromuscular connections. ",

      "header": "A couple months ago I became positive for MRSA, I am about to be 19 in March. I got it when I moved in with my Step mom, dad, and brother. I moved in around the beginning of August.  My step mom has had it for 6 years and so has my brother. I never knew exactly what it was until now.  I am afraid of dying from this, and spreading it to my boyfriend and the rest of my family. I have to get medication tonight because I currently have an outbreak under my arm and have 8 of them formed. I only had 2 last night but when I woke up there were more. Over the last couple weeks I have found myself becoming more tired as the days go on. I\u2019m going to bed around 8 and still find myself falling asleep at work, and I have been feeling really sick lately, and the MRSA hurts really badly. Everyone is worried about me and has been treating me like a walking disease. I understand they are afraid to catch it but I am taking precautions. But I don\u2019t think my step mom truly understands the issue with MRSA. They wash all of the laundry together and use the same towels. I had gotten rid of it, and had been doing my own laundry until recently when my step mom washed my clothes with hers. Now I have an outbreak. My boyfriends aunt\u2019s aunt just died last week of a staph infection, and his older sister has MRSA and another disease (I don\u2019t know what) and just found out last night that she has only days to live. I have been reading up on this online and have heard of deaths from this. What can I do to find out how serious mine is and if it is spreading internally? And what can I do to prevent it being spread to other people.",
      "body": "MRSA is otherwise known as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.  The bacteria is believed to have evolved resistance to the first few generations of antibiotics and is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections \u2013 especially in the immunocompromised or elderly.   People can have MRSA colonization or MRSA infections.  MRSA colonization is a result of having MRSA growing on your skin, nasal cavities, etc. without it causing the patient any undue stress \u2013 this is not an active infection.  A MRSA infection on the other hand is characterized by fever, chills, cough, sometimes pustules and pimples.  MRSA infections are life threatening and can potentially kill patients if untreated. It appears from your question that you are colonized with MRSA and are having sores appear under your arms.  To address the sores under your arms, one recommendation patients have found helpful is to avoid the use of antiperspirants and instead use only deodorants.  Antiperspirants can increase the chance of sores under your arms by preventing you from sweating and clogging your pores where bacteria can grow. MRSA rarely spreads and colonizes the blood in healthy patients \u2013 usually that occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, the very young, or the elderly.  Treatment for MRSA is now usually with vancomycin in those patients who require oral or IV antibiotics. The standard precautions to prevent spread of MRSA to others include standard hygiene techniques such as washing hands, covering your mouth when sneezing, cleaning surfaces and bathrooms and especially avoiding contact with infants, the elderly, or the immunocompromised.  Precautions differ based on your colonization status so you should check with your doctor. Signs that you have a serious infection include fever, chills, fatigue, etc.  Either way, you should be evaluated by your main doctor to see how bad your infection is and treatment options based on your infection status.

      "body": "Aching, tingling, numbness, and itching in the arms and hands can be benign or a symptom of an underlying disorder. These symptoms can suggest a systemic or neurologic cause. Carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression are common causes of arm pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by repetitive wrist movements, such as typing, that cause stress to the tendons and nerves in the wrist. Ulnar nerve compression is often caused by people who lean on their elbows or rest their forearms on the edge of their table. This can result in arm pain and numbness that radiates from the forearm to the ring and little finger. With local trauma ruled out, the likely culprits can be divided into endocrine diseases, neurologic diseases, cardiac/vascular disease, or vitamin deficiencies.\nRegarding endocrine diseases, diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy where your limbs become numb secondary to nerve death. However, peripheral neuropathy usually starts affecting the lower extremities first. Your doctor can screen for diabetes by measuring your blood sugar. Neurologic diseases such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathies, and spinal cord diseases can also cause bilateral arm pain. The likely culprits can be ruled out with a neurologic exam supplemented with x-rays and/or MRI as well as blood tests for syphillis. Arm aches, tingling, numbness, and itching can also be a sign of arterial insufficiency or cardiac problems such as angina where chest pain is often referred to the arm. Finally, vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and Thiamine can cause peripheral nerve problems. As the aching, tingling, numbness, and itching in your arm could be a sign of a serious medical condition, a full medical workup is warranted by your doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause.

No real burning, or blood in urine, but a weak stream and the same lower back pain that I experienced the first time around.  Should I go back to get examined even though I have my appt with a urologist in about a week and a half?  I would like to be antibiotic free in case the uro wants a sample of prostatic fluid for culture.

I\u2019m worried if I leave it to long it will spread to my bladder or my urethra.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
      "body": "From your symptoms, it sounds as if you are suffering from chronic prostatitis but your urine cultures have been negative.  This can either indicate that you have either a chronic bacterial prostatitis or a chronic abacterial prostatitis.  To distinguish between the two, you will need to have your expressed prostatic secretions cultured (not just urine samples). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the diagnosis if the expressed prostatic secretions are positive for bacteria.  It has a reputation among urologists as being difficult to treat because of the persistence of bacteria within the prostate either because of poor drainage of prostatic fluids or reflux of urine into the prostate.  The standard treatments for bacterial prostatitis are fluoroquinolones like you mentioned such as Ciprofloxacin, Oxfloxacin, or Levofloxacin.  As an alternative Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is also prescribed twice a day for a four week course and may be especially effective in patients who experience side effects from the fluoroquinolones. Chronic abacterial prostatitis mimics the symptoms of chronic bacterial prostatitis except the expressed prostatic secretions are negative for bacteria.  In fact, the majority of chronic prostatitis \u2013 up to 90% of treated patients \u2013 are abacterial.  It is important to note a negative culture does not necessarily mean there are no organisms infecting the prostate but could indicate infection by a non-culturable organism such as chlamydia, trichomonas, gonorrhea, viruses, fungi, or other rare bacteria.  Autoimmune diseases and conditions can also cause abacterial prostatitis.  The initial treatment is either with a two week trial of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) or with a quinolone.  However, your urologist might add other drugs such as Flomax or finasteride to your treatment regimen. In your case, the proper algorithm to follow four weeks of unsuccessful antibiotics is a repeat expressed prostatic secretion analysis.  At this time, your urologist might elect to either perform more tests, put you on a full course of antibiotics, or put you on additional drugs if he determines that you have abacterial prostatitis.  I would keep the appointment with your urologist and if you are concerned about antibiotics, give him/her a call to ask for advice. ",

It is unclear from your question which antibiotic and what dosage your daughter is on. Secondly, and more importantly, over 90% of adult bronchitis are caused by viral organisms (the vast majority by adenovirus) for which no antibiotic can prevent or treat.  The bacterial causes of bronchitis are usually found in chronic smokers.  Streptococcus pneumonia is the most common offending organism and is covered by most antibiotics such as azithromycin (Z-pack). Chances are your husband\u2019s bronchitis is viral in origin and your daughter\u2019s antibiotics offer no protection.  Therefore, proper hand washing, and avoiding close contact with those indviduals with bronchitis are the most important steps your daughter can take. ",

In other words, trichomoniasis is defined as a sexually transmitted infection. Trichomoniasis is suspected in female patients with malodorous vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, or vulvar itching.  The standard tests include vaginal swab microscopy (which can visualize the organism 60-70%) and vaginal cultures (which can detect the organism 95% of the time).  Much rarer are PCR tests for trichomonas which can detect the organisms proteins 84% of the time. Therefore, it is possible to have tested negative for trichomonas and still have it.

      "body": "Itchy and swollen feet as you are describing can be a number of possibilities including but not limited to cardiovascular problems, diabetes, dermatitis, insect bites, or fungal infections. Given that you are complaining of feet swelling when you stand or walk, this could be an underlying sign of cardiovascular problems such as heart failure.  Heart failure leads to poor circulatory effort and decreased venous return thereby leading to pooling of fluids in the lowest part of your body \u2013 your feet.  A similar problem arises with diabetes whereby the small vessels and nerves in your feet are damaged by high blood sugar and fluid pools in your feet causing swelling.  The itchiness and spots you are seeing could be a result of irritation due to this swelling. Dermatitis and insect bites can both cause inflammatory reactions in your feet causing swelling and itchiness.  Dermatitis results from contact with something that irritates your skin \u2013 the leather or dye on new sandals, nickel on toe rings, poison ivy, new detergent used to wash your socks, etc.  Insect bites such as mosquitoes, bed bugs, etc. can cause similar symptoms. Lastly fungal infections such as \u201cathletes foot\u201d can cause similar symptoms.  This is a fungal infection causing itching and blisters to develop as well as scaling and flaking of the affected areas.  Treatment can be with topical antifungals such as lotramin (available over the counter) or with prescription oral antifungals. If your feet have been progressively swelling, swollen for weeks, you have heart problems, you suspect a fungal infection, or you have diabetes, a visit to your primary care physician to evaluate the symptoms and proper control of your underlying condition would be warranted.  If you suspect dermatitis, remove the suspected irritant from your feet and treat with anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl.  If other people in your family have similar swelling and itchiness, you suspect insect bites, anti-itch cream such as cortizone or benadryl could be  ",

There are a number of possibilities for the etiology of the \u201cwhite/pinkish blotches of dry, flaky skin.\u201d.  On the top of the list includes dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, fungal infections, or vitamin deficiencies. Psoriasis is a common noncontagious disease of autoimmune etiology.  It is a result of an overgrowth of skin cells that result in plaques forming in discreet regions.  Nailbeds are frequently affected and nail damage is often a symptom.  Treatment is often with steroids or other immunomodulators. Eczema is thought to be an allergic reaction of the skin to external allergens.  It appears as dry, inflammed, and red patches of skin.  Like psoriasis, treatment is either with steroids and immunomodulators. Fungal infections such as ring worm can cause similar symptoms as you are describing.  Ring worm is caused by dermatophyte fungi \u2013 typically Tinea corporis and can arise in red, dry, circular lesions on the skin.  Usually, treatment is with a topical antifungal for 4-6 weeks can cure the fungal infection. Lastly vitamin deficiencies can cause dermatologic problems.

Additional symptoms such as hot flashes, loss of libido, fatigue, and irritability would all point to the diagnosis of menopause.  The average age for menopause in modern women is approximately 50-52 years. By definition, a woman is menopausal if she has no menses for a period of 12 months and all other medical reasons have been excluded.  It is unlikely that birth control pills are contributing to your diminished periods unless you have recently changed pills.  Undergoing menopause at the age of 38 is not uncommon especially if there is a family history of early menopause (if your mother, aunts, sisters, grandmothers all had early menopause, then it is likely you will undergo early menopause).  However, you should be evaluated for medical causes of your decreasing periods.  Hormone levels fluctuate daily based on a variety of factors; they are a poor indicator of menopause and should not be used to diagnose menopause.  However, an ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial lining is often performed for anovulatory (not ovulating) women around the age of menopause or post-menopausal who are still having vaginal spotting or continuous vaginal bleeding.

Taking your reported number of sexual partners and assuming you are from New York, you probably had encounters with 75 people that were infected with genital herpes.  Therefore, you had approximately a 5% chance of contracting herpes from each of your 75 encounters. Genital Herpes is commonly caused by Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), although the oral version HSV-1 can also cause genital herpes.  Herpetic outbreaks cause painful genital sores and potential birth defects in women.  It is estimated that up to 80% of the infected population is asymptomatic. Using a condom doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent transmission of genital herpes as skin-on-skin contact can transmit the virus.

      "body": "From the question, it appears that you are experiencing memory problems and hallucinations after taking Concerta (Methylphenidate).  Concerta is also marketed as Ritalin and is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy, and other developmental disorders.  It functions by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain by prevent their re-uptake in neurotransmitter junctions.  Concerta has a number of side effects, some of which affect the brain and are serious. Although memory problems are not a known side effect of Concerta, patients who experience hallucinations should seek immediate medical attention from their primary care physician, psychiatrist, or the primary prescriber of the medication as it could be a sign of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Your reported history of memory disturbances, decreased concentration, bizarre lucid dreams, and decreased sleep is suspicious for an underlying psychiatric disorder such as bipolar disorder or possibly schizophrenia.  You should be evaluated by your primary care physician, psychiatrist, or primary prescriber of the Concerta and especially if you have a family history of psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.

My medical insurance was canceled when the appointment was made to have the surgery so I couldn\u2019t have anything done because of no insurance.

      "body": "It sounds like you are having neuropathic pain affecting the left arm from the axilla to the fingers.  Seeing how you have had surgery on your neck, that appears to be the most likely culprit of your pain.  Based on your history, it is likely that your pain is caused by nerve impingement at the level of your cervical spine (the area of the spinal cord that\u2019s located in your neck). The location of your pain in relationship to your arm can localize the specific nerves that are impinged.  If your arm is numb around the area of your upper shoulder to your outer bicep and down to your thumb, it suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 5th or 6th cervical vertebrae.  Numbness affecting the back of your shoulder to the back of your elbow and down to your index and middle fingers suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 7th cervical vertebrae.  Finally, numbness at the area of your triceps to your ring and pinky finger suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 8th cervical vertebrae or 1st thoracic vertebrae.  The information regarding where your pain is exactly located is important for your doctor to determine which level of your spinal cord is affected. If the pain is mild and there is no associated weakness in the arm, then pharmacotherapy with neurologic drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin) have been found to be very effective in controlling neuropathic pain.  Muscle relaxants have also been used with varied results.   If the pain is persistently moderate to severe, worsening, or associated with muscle weakness, then a detailed medical evaluation by your primary care physicial, a neurologist, or a spine specialist (orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon) with associated imaging such as an MRI of the cervical spine is warranted.  These symptoms suggest a serious problem which may result in serious, irreversible nerve damage and surgery might be indicated. ",

This has only been going on since Monday of last week.",
      "body": "The symptoms you are describing \u2013 burning sensation throughout the day in your hands and feet \u2013 appear to be either neurologic in nature or due to medication reaction with your phentermine.  Some people have adverse reactions when quitting smoking, but quitting smoking in itself has not been known to cause a burning sensation.  A burning sensation in the hands and feet could be an indication for a neuropathy.  Diabetic neuropathy, a result of uncontrolled blood sugar, will damage the nerves in the hands and feet and cause an intense burning.  This disorder is common among diabetics and can be screened for with blood glucose tests or hemoglobin A1C tests.  Other causes of burning sensations include vitamin A, B complex, and E deficiencies.  In addition, patients suffering from anxiety have also reported symptoms of \u201cburning\u201d in their limbs. Medication interactions, especially with phentermine, can occur and cause these symptoms.  A reaction known as \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d can occur when one takes certain antidepressants with phentermine and results in warmth/flushing, increased body temperature, fast heart rate, nausea, vomiting, or psychomotor agitation. These symptoms you are experiencing warrant a physical exam and blood tests by your primary care physician to evaluate the cause, especially since they have been occurring for about a week.  The physician can evaluate for any medication interaction, side effects of your current medications, or any new changes you might have started over the last few weeks that are contributing to your symptoms.

However, persistent tinnitus warrants medical testing.  In your case, since you stated you had an accident resulting ni tinnitus, it appears that the root cause may be damage to the nerve endings of the inner ear.   Other causes of tinnitus include aspirin overdose, Meniere\u2019s syndrome, vascular abnormalities, or masses in the brain.   Evaluation for tinnitus should include a detailed physical and neurologic exam as well as auditory testing or MRIs of the brain if warranted.   Unfortunately, because tinnitus is a symptom with a wide range of etiologies, there is no one specific treatment.  If an underlying cause can be detected by your primary care physician then (s)he can treat the cause.  However, if the diagnosis remains unsolved, then referral to a neurologist or ENT doctor may be pursued for further evaluation. For nerve damage causing tinnitus, some patients have found niacin supplementation to be helpful in reducing tinnitus.  Others have reported positive effects by taking gabapentin (neurontin).

      "body": "It appears that you have suffered from statin induced myopathy secondary to your simvastatin.  Statins are commonly prescribed to to treat hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and have a relatively low rate of side effects.  The most common side effects are muscle myopathies which range from an asymptomatic rise in creatine phosphokinase (a byproduct of muscle breakdown) to mild myalgia (muscle pain) to rhabdomyalysis (rapid, fulminant muscle breakdown).  Muscular side effects can be expected in 10 to 15% of statin users. The prognosis varies depending on the condition: a patient who has suffered statin induced rhabdomyalysis \u2013 a rapid, fulminant destruction of muscle tissue \u2013 will have a much longer recovery time than a patient suffering from statin induced myalgia.  Diagnosis of rhabdomyalsis includes an elevation in creatine phosphokinase, elevation in potassium, deterioration of kidney function, dark urine, as well as extreme weakness and muscle pain.  From what you are describing, it appears that you have a statin induced myalgia.  The overall prognosis of this condition is extremely favorable as long as it is recognized and treated promptly.   The first line of treatment is to discontinue the statin.  Secondly, adequate hydration must be maintained to prevent any kidney damage.  Recent trials have shown vitamin D therapy, for those deficient in vitamin D, to be effective in treating and aiding recovery from statin induced myopathy.  There have been clinical trials of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in patients with statin myopathy but the results have been inconcusive and there is no evidence to support its use to treat statin induced myopathy. In my experience, elderly patients who have had statin induced myopathy take anywhere from 3 months to over a year after stopping statins to recover from the muscle aches.  The most important factor in these patient\u2019s recovery is to resume as much of their daily activities and exercise as they can tolerate.  Bedrest is not advised, especially in the elderly, as it will deteriorate their muscles even further and further compromise their strength. ",

However, common things being common, carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression are common causes of arm pain.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by repetitive wrist movements, such as typing, that cause stress to the tendons and nerves in the wrist.  Ulnar nerve compression is often caused by people who lean on their elbows or rest their forearms on the edge of their table.  This can result in arm pain and numbness that radiates from the forearm to the ring and little finger.\nWith local trauma ruled out, the likely culprits can be divided into endocrine diseases, neurologic diseases, cardiac/vascular disease, or vitamin deficiencies.\nRegarding endocrine diseases, diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy where your limbs become numb secondary to nerve death.  However, peripheral neuropathy usually starts affecting the lower extremities first.  Your doctor can screen for diabetes by measuring your blood sugar.\nNeurologic diseases such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathies, and spinal cord diseases can also cause bilateral arm pain.  The likely culprits can be ruled out with a neurologic exam supplemented with x-rays and/or MRI as well as blood tests for syphillis.\nArm pain can also be a sign of arterial insufficiency or cardiac problems such as angina where chest pain is often referred to the arm.\nFinally, as you mentioned that you get arm pain while drinking, vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and Thiamine can cause peripheral nerve problems.\nBecause your symptoms are increasing in frequency, a full medical workup is warranted by your medical doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause.

      "body": "It sounds like you are having neuropathic pain affecting the left arm from the axilla to the fingers.  Seeing how you have had surgery on your neck, that appears to be the most likely culprit of your pain.  Based on your history, it is likely that your pain is caused by nerve impingement at the level of your cervical spine (the area of the spinal cord that\u2019s located in your neck). The location of your pain in relationship to your arm can localize the specific nerves that are impinged.  If your arm is numb around the area of your upper shoulder to your outer bicep and down to your thumb, it suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 5th or 6th cervical vertebrae.  Numbness affecting the back of your shoulder to the back of your elbow and down to your index and middle fingers suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 7th cervical vertebrae.  Finally, numbness at the area of your triceps to your ring and pinky finger suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 8th cervical vertebrae or 1st thoracic vertebrae.  The information regarding where your pain is exactly located is important for your doctor to determine which level of your spinal cord is affected. If the pain is mild and there is no associated weakness in the arm, then pharmacotherapy with neurologic drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin) have been found to be very effective in controlling neuropathic pain.  Muscle relaxants have also been used with varied results.   If the pain is persistently moderate to severe, worsening, or associated with muscle weakness, then a detailed medical evaluation by your primary care physicial, a neurologist, or a spine specialist (orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon) with associated imaging such as an MRI of the cervical spine is warranted.  These symptoms suggest a serious problem which may result in serious, irreversible nerve damage and surgery might be indicated. ",

One condition that comes to mind that involves both sudden onset weight loss and a sweet taste in the back of the mouth is diabetes.  Excessive urination, excessive thirst, and sudden onset weight loss are all signs of diabetes and requires immediate medical attention.

Can you please help me to solve it out?",
      "body": "Phlegm in the back of the throat is often a symptom of an underlying condition.  The most common causes of phlegm in the back of the throat include post nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and environmental exposure. Post nasal drip is a condition with excessive mucus production by the nasal mucosa which accumulates in the back of the nose or the throat.  Patients often report symptoms such as constant swallowing, frequent spitting, difficulty breathing, and coughing.  Post nasal drip is often caused by allergic rhinitis but it can also be caused by sinusitis or GERD.  Treatment includes antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, antibiotics for sinusitis, and proton pump inhibitors for GERD. GERD, also known as acid reflux, is a disease characterized by constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.  Patients often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation.  Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping.  Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. Lastly, environmental exposure can cause excessive phlegm production.  Smoking or second hand smoke is one of the most common cause of phlegm.  Other irritants or allergens such as pollen, mold, fumes, pet dander, etc. can also cause an increased production in phlegm.  Treatment involves identifying and eliminating the source. In your case, the likely culprits from your excessive phlegm include allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, gastric reflux, or an environmental exposure.  An evaluation by your doctor to identify possible causes of your phlegm production would include a physical exam and careful history.  If appropriate, antibiotics to treat an underlying infection, antihistamines to treat post nasal drip, or a trial of proton pump inhibitors to treat GERD might be indicated.   ",

      "body": "From what you are describing, it appears that you had an HIV ELISA test at an institution where they pricked your finger and sampled the blood directly from your finger with a micropipette instead of a capillary tube.  While technically improper, if the finger was properly sterilized and the lancet as well as the micropipette tip were both new and sterile, this does not put you at an elevated risk for contracting blood borne diseases such as HIV.  Micropipettes are set to draw up a specific volume into their tips.  When handled properly, no fluid should ever touch the micropipette itself \u2013 only the tip.  Therefore when the tip is disposed, any contaminant is eliminated as well.  Their technique, although unorthodox, does not appear to cross contaminate blood from one test subject to another from what you are describing. HIV tests are not performed on whole blood because the virus resides in the serum.  It is standard practice for blood taken from a patient to be spun in a centrifuge so the cells can be eliminated and the serum sampled for the test.  One can speculate that the person taking your blood with the micropipette ran the HIV ELISA test directly on the blood.  If this is the case, then there is a higher chance of a false negative (a person with HIV tests negative for HIV).  However, from what you are describing, there is no way of knowing if the institution spun the blood and performed the test on the serum or if they performed the test directly on the blood.  If this is an accredited institution for running HIV tests, then there is no reason not to trust the results of your exam. ",

      "body": "The symptoms you are describing \u2013 burning sensation throughout the day in your hands and feet \u2013 appear to be either neurologic in nature or due to medication reaction with your phentermine.  Some people have adverse reactions when quitting smoking, but quitting smoking in itself has not been known to cause a burning sensation.  A burning sensation in the hands and feet could be an indication for a neuropathy.  Diabetic neuropathy, a result of uncontrolled blood sugar, will damage the nerves in the hands and feet and cause an intense burning.  This disorder is common among diabetics and can be screened for with blood glucose tests or hemoglobin A1C tests.  Other causes of burning sensations include vitamin A, B complex, and E deficiencies.  In addition, patients suffering from anxiety have also reported symptoms of \u201cburning\u201d in their limbs. Medication interactions, especially with phentermine, can occur and cause these symptoms.  A reaction known as \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d can occur when one takes certain antidepressants with phentermine and results in warmth/flushing, increased body temperature, fast heart rate, nausea, vomiting, or psychomotor agitation. These symptoms you are experiencing warrant a physical exam and blood tests by your primary care physician to evaluate the cause, especially since they have been occurring for about a week.  The physician can evaluate for any medication interaction, side effects of your current medications, or any new changes you might have started over the last few weeks that are contributing to your symptoms.

Alternatively, a low dose short acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam can also be used 1-2 hours before speaking in public.  If the public speaking and presentations are regular, patients often adapt and long term pharmacotherapy is usually not necessary.\nIn addition to pharmacotherapy, patients have also been shown to benefit from psychotherapy which involves addressing the underlying issues that cause the specific phobias.

      "body": "From your symptoms it appears that you are suffering from Orthostatic Hypotension \u2013 otherwise known as a \u201chead rush.\u201d  Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate.  The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting.  These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.    The most common causes of orthostatic hypotension can be divided into 3 catagories: Volume Depletion, Neurologic Abnormalities, and Medication.   Volume Depletion either from dehydration, anemia, or excessive fluid loss (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) can result in decreased intravascular volume and low blood pressure that can further be exacerbated by standing too fast.   Neurologic disorders can result in the inability of the body to constrict blood vessels in the leg as a person stands resulting in too much blood pooling in the legs and the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  Typically, this occurs in people with nerve damage, diabetes, dysautonomia, or other genetic/neurologic diseases.   Lastly, medications such as diuretics, antidepressants, or nerve blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension as part of their side effects.   It is not uncommon for people your age to suffer from orthostatic hypotension especially if you are in a growth spurt.  However, you should be evaluated by your primary doctor to see if there are any medical conditions contributing to your orthostatic hypotension. ",

      "body": "It appears that you have hypothyroidism which requires you to take Synthroid (a synthetic thyroid hormone).  The majority of the time in developed countries, hypothyroidism is caused by autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.  Rarely, hypothyroidism can be caused by iodine deficiency \u2013 but this is extremely uncommon in developed countries as the salt is usually fortified with iodine. Sea Kelp contains high levels of iodine and may be recommended by some practitioners of alternative medicine for \u201cthyroid support.\u201d  In terms of the physiologic need for iodine, seas kelp supplementation would ONLY be necessary if the person is actually deficient in iodine.  In most other cases, Sea Kelp supplementation would have no effect or even a potentially adverse effect. Although every individual is different, the vast majority of patients prescribed Synthroid have hypothyroidism that is unrelated to iodine deficiency.  Therefore, chances are, sea kelp supplementation would not be beneficial and you should continue taking Synthroid.  If you do decided to take sea kelp, you should first consult the doctor who prescribed your Synthroid to determine if iodine supplementation is beneficial or safe. ",

I am currently itching again and my hair on testicles have grown double what they were. what could cause this? From what you are describing, enlarged, burning, and itching with a bump on the inner side of the thigh sounds as if it could be local irritation to the skin caused by shaving and resulting in a dermatitis. Other common causes of your symptoms are folliculitis or a yeast infection.  Folliculitis is a bacterial overgrowth of the sweat/hair follicles of your skin.  Shaving can predispose you to folliculitis as it can cause ingrown hairs and trap bacteria in the follicles.  A yeast infection is also common in the groin area and can present with a similar pattern \u2013 treatment with an antifungal, such as diflucan, can be effective in curing your condition. Your symptoms are unlikely to be from herpes as the vesicles are exquisitely painful with a tingling/burning sensation prior to the development of vesicles. However, a form of chlamydia known as \u201clymphogranuloma venereum\u201d (LGV) can also present in a similar pattern.  LGV is caused by the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and invades the lymphatic system causing swelling and irritation.  Initial presentation may be a painless genital ulcer 1-2 weeks after innoculation of the bacterial which resolves within a few days.  After the primary stage heals, the secondary stage can occur weeks to months later with the infection spreading from the skin to the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes resulting in swelling/redness/tenderness (most often only on one side), in the groin or inner thigh.  The disease can be screened for with standard STD tests but rarely negative test results may require a biopsy of the affected area to visualize the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria.  Treatment with the proper antibiotics such as erythromycin or doxycycline can cure the infection and resolve the symptoms. And to address your final concern regarding your hairs growing back double \u2026 that doesn\u2019t appear to make medical sense. If your symptoms worsen or do no resolve with your current treatment regimen, you need to consult a licensed physician to evaluate you and determine the cause. ",

Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.

The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

Note, however, one major difference between marijuana and cigarettes is that cigarettes are tightly controlled for quality of ingredients.  Marijuana is not regulated, and in addition, the lack of a filter leads to the user inhaling more carcinogenic agents produced by the burning of marijuana leaves.  There are many comparisons between marijuana and cigarettes available online if you are so interested. There are many studies showing that marijuana has carcinogens (up to 70% more than cigarettes) and irritants to the lung.  Lung tissue of marijuana users indicate a decrease in regenerative potential.  However, at the rate of 3 puffs per day, the chances of actually developing lung, throat, or esophageal cancer from Marijuana with even decades of smoking is slim to none.  But that being said, marijuana smoke still irritates the lung and increases the phlegm production as well as increases the user\u2019s risk of developing pneumonias. One recent study showed that marijuana users experience an increased heart rate as well as and increased chance of developing arrythmias and palpitations.  This results in an increased risk of developing a heart attack from using marijuana.  This risk is much greater in the elderly population than in the young population and much greater in those with pre-existing heart conditions. Finally, there are studies that suggest marijuana is associated with mental conditions such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.  However, these are just associations and no cause-effect has ever been established. ",

      "body": "Parasitic infections are exceedingly rare in industrialized nations and are mostly found in third world countries that lack clean water, sterile food, etc.  Therefore, if you reside in an industrialized nation, there is no clinical indication for prophylactic treatment of parasites. There are many classes of parasites.  For the purpose of your question, we will simplify them into: 1) those that infect the intestinal tract (round worms, tape worms, etc), 2) those that infect the blood (malaria), 3) those that infect the genitourinary tract (schistosomes and trichomonas), and 4) those that infect the brain (naegleria). For intestinal parasites, your doctor can run a simple stool test for ova and parasites if you experience symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, etc.  The treatment for most intestinal worm infections is one to two doses of albendazole or mebendazole. For infections of the blood with parasites such as malaria, your doctor can obtain a blood smear to look for malaria if you experience symptoms such as cyclical fevers.  Malaria can be prevented by prophylactic drugs prior to travel to an endemic area but can also be treated once contracted and is rarely deadly once treatment is initiated. Genitourinary infections with schistosomes would produce bloody urine and trichomonas a frothy discharge.  Both of these can be tested for by your doctor if you have symptoms and both are readily treatable. Infections by naegleria fowleri are exceedingly rare but also rapidly fatal.  These infections primary occur in people swimming in warm, freshwater lakes where the parasite invades the human via the nasal canal.  There are a few treatment regimens available (such as amphotericin B) but the majority of infections lead to death.  There is no prophylaxis for this parasite. In summary, there is no reason for prophylactic treatment of parasites for individual without risk factors or exposure.  If any symptoms arise, your doctor can readily test for parasites and offer the appropriate treatment.  Furthermore, there exists no one way to \u201ccleanse\u201d your body of parasites as each class of parasite affects different organisms and the treatment regimen is unique for each parasite.  And regarding those online \u201cdetoxes\u201d or \u201ccleanses\u201d that promises to rid your body of parasites, there does not appear to be any medical evidence or legitimacy to support those claims.

      "body": "Aching, tingling, numbness, and itching in the arms and hands can be benign or a symptom of an underlying disorder. These symptoms can suggest a systemic or neurologic cause. Carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression are common causes of arm pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by repetitive wrist movements, such as typing, that cause stress to the tendons and nerves in the wrist. Ulnar nerve compression is often caused by people who lean on their elbows or rest their forearms on the edge of their table. This can result in arm pain and numbness that radiates from the forearm to the ring and little finger. With local trauma ruled out, the likely culprits can be divided into endocrine diseases, neurologic diseases, cardiac/vascular disease, or vitamin deficiencies.\nRegarding endocrine diseases, diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy where your limbs become numb secondary to nerve death. However, peripheral neuropathy usually starts affecting the lower extremities first. Your doctor can screen for diabetes by measuring your blood sugar. Neurologic diseases such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathies, and spinal cord diseases can also cause bilateral arm pain. The likely culprits can be ruled out with a neurologic exam supplemented with x-rays and/or MRI as well as blood tests for syphillis. Arm aches, tingling, numbness, and itching can also be a sign of arterial insufficiency or cardiac problems such as angina where chest pain is often referred to the arm. Finally, vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and Thiamine can cause peripheral nerve problems. As the aching, tingling, numbness, and itching in your arm could be a sign of a serious medical condition, a full medical workup is warranted by your doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause.

      "body": "The symptoms you are describing are consistent with an ileus.  An ileus, also known as a bowel obstruction, is a disruption of the normal forward flow of the gastrointestinal tract.  An ileus can be mechanical or non-mechanical.  Symptoms often include excessive burping/belching, abdominal distension/discomfort, constipation, and lack of flatulence or bowel movements.   Causes can include episodes of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea that leave the bowel irritated.  Previous abdominal surgeries (appendectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy etc) can result in bowel adhesions that obstruct forward flow.  Ulcers can irritate the gastrointestinal tract decreasing motility.  Masses and tumors can mechanically obstruct the forward flow.  And neuropathies such as those associated with diabetes can damage gastrointestinal nerves and result in improper/absent motility.  If the symptoms have a clear provocation (such as gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and diarrhea) and resolve on their own without sequelae then no medical intervention is needed.  However, if these symptoms have been occurred before without an identifiable cause, you have a prior history of abdominal surgery, the symptoms do no improve, you are not passing gas, or you start vomiting, then prompt medical attention is needed.  Studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast can usually localize the site of the obstruction and identify any structural abnormality. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you have two major issues: family history of pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) and recurrent gastrointestinal pains. A family history of pulmonary emboli can mean there is either a family history of cancer or a genetic component that is causing the blood to be hypercoagulable (easier to form clots).  Cancer is one of the major causes blood thickening that results in clots in the veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and float to the lung.  Genetic causes for hypercoagulation are known to run in families.  Factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic causes of hypercoagulability occurring in 3-7% of the general population.  Other causes include Prothrombin 20210A, Lupus Anticoagulant, Protein C or S deficiency, etc.  These genetic diseases result in blood that clots more readily and can result in blood cloots in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and end up in the lung.  Blood tests can determine if you any clotting disorder \u2013 your d-dimer test appears to be normal given the clinical circumstance.  If your doctor suspect blood clots in the leg, a doppler study of the lower can visualize the veins. You second condition relates the the gastrointestinal tract.  Most common causes of abdominal pain in young females include ovulatory pains, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or food allergies (including lactose intolerance).  More rarer are diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn\u2019s disease.  Your gastrointestinal condition should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist who can properly test you for the conditions.  If you are indeed experiencing symptoms of diverticulitis (which is rare in someone of your age), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a colonoscopy to follow if there is suspicion of colonic pathology. In the end, if your doctor is blowing you off and does not seem interested in diagnosing your condition, it might be time to search for a new one. ",

      "body": "Alcohol is detrimental to both the mother and the infant.  Alcohol inhibits the hormonal effects necessary for healthy breast milk production.  As a rapidly absorbed drug, alcohol is detectable in the blood within 15 minutes of production and in breast milk shortly afterwards.  Peak alcohol levels in milk occur anywhere from 30-90 minutes depending type of alcohol and whether it was taken with food.   Alcohol\u2019s affect on the nursing infant is determined by the quantity consumed, mother\u2019s drinking pattern, and time interval between alcohol consumption and nursing.   Even small amounts of alcohol consumed by the mother (1-2 drinks) can be a huge burden for infants because their immature liver cannot metabolize the alcohol burden.   Short term effects of alcohol include documented evidence that it can induce a drunken state in the infant.  In addition, alcohol affects infantile sleep and eating patterns \u2013 decreasing both sleep time and breast milk consumption.   In terms long-term effects on the baby\u2019s behavioral system and nutritional effects, alcohol is detrimental to both systems.  Alcohol has been found to hinder infantile development \u2013 babies of alcoholic mothers were smaller in stature and lagged in fine motor skills from their counterparts. Although no detectable effect was found on mental development, alcohol is still highly discouraged as the studies performed were not designed to detect such deficits.  According to the 2007 guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cBreastfeeding mothers should avoid the use of alcoholic beverages, because alcohol is concentrated in breast milk and its use can inhibit milk production. An occasional celebratory single, small alcoholic drink is acceptable, but breastfeeding should be avoided for 2 hours after the drink.\u201d ",

      "body": "It appears as if you are describing the symptom of hyperreflexia where patients twitch or have spastic tendencies especially when you are excited.   The numbness/tingling in your fingers is a normal physiologic reaction to excitement \u2013 some people are just more sensitive to it.  The explanation relates to the calcium balance.  When most people get excited, they tend to breathe faster causing them to excrete more CO2 from the blood.  This increases the pH of the blood making it more basic.  As your blood becomes more basic, the proteins in your blood develop a higher affinity to blood calcium and therefore decreases the amount of free calcium in the bood.  This in turn results in a pseudo-hypocalcium which most people experience as a tingling/twitching/numbness in the fingers, toes, or lips. Causes for hyperreflexia can also be due to drug side effects, electrolyte abnormalities or upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) disease. Drugs such as stimulants (some of the most common include those used to treat attention deficit disorder such as Ritalin) can cause hyperreflexia.  In addition, the side effects of certain classes of antipsychotic drugs can cause tremors. Electrolyte abnormalities such as true hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch.  Conversely, extremely high levels of calcium may also cause your muscles to twitch. Neurologic diseases such as those that cause upper motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (abbreviated ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), primary lateral sclerosis (abbreviated PLS), or pseudobulbar palsy.  Most of these diseases are progressive and the symptoms quite severe.  Therefore, with isolated finger numbness, it is unlikely you have these conditions. Although it is completely normal for you to feel numbness in your fingers when you are excited, it is more concerning if you have the numbness when not excited.  If the numbness persists or worsens, your primary doctor should perform a detailed physical exam as well as draw labs such as calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone levels.  If warranted a electromyogram may be performed to check the neuromuscular connections. ",

If an underlying cause can be detected by your primary care physician then (s)he can treat the cause.  However, if the diagnosis remains unsolved, then referral to a neurologist or ENT doctor may be pursued for further evaluation.

Saw palmetto is a herbal drug extracted from the saw palmetto fruit.  It has been used for centuries in herbal and alternative medical practices.  It has been believed to be effective in treating gynecologic and urologic issues such as menstrual discomfort and infertility in women as well as reduce the incontinence associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy. However, saw palmetto has not been scientifically proven to improve urinary flow.  In a 2006 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 225 men over the age of 49 years who had moderate-to-severe symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated with saw palmetto extract (160 mg twice a day) or placebo.  The authors found that there was no significant difference between the saw palmetto and placebo groups in the change in maximal urinary flow rate, prostate size, residual volume after voiding, quality of life, or serum prostate-specific antigen levels during the one-year study.

However, there are several indications for emergency dialysis: 1) Potassium elevation with EKG changes\n2) Toxic ingestion or overdose of drugs/toxins such as Lithium.\n3) Toxic uremia with evidence of bleeding disorders, pericarditis, cerebral edema.\n4) Fluid overload with unrefractory hypoxia ",

Hearing loss is a common complaint with Paget\u2019s disease, believed to be because of thickening of the canal your auditory nerve travels through. It is thought to occur in about 40% of people with the disease. Your doctor can help you decrease the likelihood of hearing loss by prescribing you drugs that decrease bone turnover such as calcitonin or bisphosphonates. It is important to note that treatment is experimental and is unlikely to reverse any existing hearing loss. ",

This pain can last an hour to 12 hours\u2026  I have tried OTC aleve, ibeuprofen, and tylenol, the best thing so far is a heating pad but none of these help eleviate the pain.  I also have polycystic ovarian syndrome, but my obgyn did a ultrasound and that does not seem to be the problem with the abdominal pain.  People have suggested to me that maybe it is something with the bowels, but I don\u2019t seem to have a problem having a bm and all that seems to be normal\u2026.  HELP!  any suggestions",
      "body": "You appear to be suffering from abdominal pain that may or may not be related to your scoliosis and/or your polycystic ovaries.  You have already undergone and ultrasound which was negative.  At this point, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated to evaluate for any anatomic or pathologic cause of abdominal pain. Your symptoms are too vague to narrow the differential, but patients with severe scoliosis often develop back pain at some point in their life.  Surgery is warranted in those patients who fail medical management and have unrelenting pain primarily due to the scoliosis.  Therefore, if your CT is negative, you should be evaluated by a spine specialist to determine if the scoliosis is causing your pain and if surgery is indicated in your case. ",

      "body": "The standard treatment for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (runny/itching nose and red/itchy/watery eyes) is often with over the counter second generation H1 Antihistamines (like allegra).  There are other medication options you can explore with your primary healthcare provider.  Many H1 antihistamines are available with pseudoephedrine which enhances relief of nasal congestion.  Studies have shown second generation H1 antihistamines to have either similar or greater efficacy in relieving symptoms than topical cromoglycate, montelukast, and nedocromil.  But the most effective drug at relieving allergic symptoms appears to be glucocorticoids (steroids).  However, these drugs have a higher potential of causing side effects and should be used with caution and only after discussing the risks and benefits with your primary healthcare provider. ",

From your question, there is certainly a chance you can impregnate your wife naturally if the only issue is a deletion of a portion of the Y chromosome.  Depending on your exact type of Y chromosome deletion and the extent of deletion, you may have either no decreased chance of impregnating your wife or you may have have a 50% reduction in impregnating your wife.  In the former, you would have normal daughters but your sons would also likely carry your Y chromosome deletion.  In the latter, we are assuming that your Y chromosome deletion has no impact on your X chromosome but the Y chromosome is incompatible with life.  Therefore you can only have daughters as only your sperm with X chromosomes are viable.  The remaining 50% of your sperm containing the mutated Y chromosome is incompatible with life. ",

Another factor that may be contributing to your loss of menstrual periods is the recent move from Dubai to India.  Stress is a major factor that can inhibit ovulation and menstruation. Given that your pregnancy tests have been negative, it is unlikely that you are pregnant.  In addition, you have had menstrual bleeding so a serious disorder with your pituitary gland is unlikely.  If you are breast feeding, your periods should return to normal in a few months after you stop.  If you continue to have menstrual irregularity in the coming months or cease to have periods, you should seek medical attention. ",

Conditions such as ingrown hairs (folliculitis barbae) or \u201crazor bumps\u201d (pseudo-folliculitis barbae) are common if patients shave or wax their pubic region and often result in local inflammation or sometimes pain. Treatment consists of cleansing the area, applying warm compresses, and applying salicylic acid toners to the affected area. If you are sexually active, blisters in your pubic region can also be secondary to STDs such as those caused by HPV, Herpes Virus, Syphillis, or Chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi).  HPV is the cause of genital warts which results in irritated skin that can sometimes present as a blister.  Herpes Virus is another STD that causes painful blisters to appear in affected areas.  A painless ulcer in the genital region that bleeds can be the first sign of a Syphillis infection.  Finally, chancroid infections result in a painful ulcer in the genital region. ",

Armour Thyroid is a porcine based thyroid hormone replacement used to treat hypothyroidism.  Thyroid medication and thyroid disorders can certainly affect your period.  In general, too much thyroid hormone can decrease the frequency of your periods or making your periods lighter. A deficit of thyroid hormone can lead to increased frequency of periods, heavier periods, and even an increase in the pain and discomfort of menstruation.  Dicontinuing thyroid hormone medication can certainly affect menstruation.  The affects are most likely temporary but it may take a few cycles before your periods normalize.  Meanwhile, the most common cause of missed period is pregnancy, therefore a pregnancy test is warranted if you have been sexually active. ",

Early satiation and diarrhea are symptoms related to gastrointestinal pathology and can be do to something benign such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  Rarely, it can be an indication of gastrointestinal malignancy.  Since you are 54, a screening colonoscopy is indicated for someone your age.  If it turns out you do have irritable bowel syndrome, then taking fiber may help. More likely, your gastrointestinal symptoms are due to an excess of thyroid hormone in your body due to Synthroid.  Excess thyroid hormone will mimic the symptoms of hyperthryoidism such as rapid heart rate, diarrhea, excessive feelings of warmth, etc.  A simple blood test will tell you if your levels are appropriate.  Oftentimes, diet changes, changes in metabolism, or the addition of new medications can alter the metabolism of existing drugs such as Synthroid.

Hyperthyroidism can be asymptomatic but it can also affect your menstrual cycle by decreasing the frequency of your periods and making your periods lighter.  In severe cases, hyperthyroidism can cause menstruation to cease. Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) is the underproduction of thyroid hormones.  Hypothyroidism can also be asymptomatic but it can also affect your menstrual cycle by increasing the frequency of periods, causing heavy periods with increased or prolonged menstrual bleeding, or even increase the pain and discomfort of menstruation.  Since you\u2019ve already had a thyroid lobectomy and are on replacement thyroid hormone (Synthroid), you can suffer from both hyper and hypothyroidism based on your dosage of Synthroid.  There are many drugs and foods that can interact and increase or decrease the metabolism of the replacement thyroid hormone.

Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate. The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting. These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.  Common causes of orthostatic hypotension include volume depletion, neurologic abnormalities, and medication. If raising your arms causes you dizziness, you should be evaluated by a doctor for a physical exam \u2013 especially if you can consistently replicate the symptoms.  Commonly, compression of the large blood vessels in the neck/upper thorax can produce a dizzy sensation.

Shipyard workers and construction workers with asbestos related diseases generally have been exposed high quantity of airborne asbestos for many years. In your case, removal of a basement full of asbestos containing tiles does not turn your home into a health hazard \u2013 especially if the tiles were in good shape and you didn\u2019t sand, grind, or demolish the stones.  While each person\u2019s susceptibility to disease is unique, there is a low chance of developing any asbestos related diseases from the minor construction you describe.   You should consult your family physician but from what you are describing, no medical testing is warranted at this time.  However, it may be beneficial, for peace of mind, to avoid using your basement until you test it for airborne asbestos and wash any potentially contaminated clothing/materials. ",

A family history of pulmonary emboli can mean there is either a family history of cancer or a genetic component that is causing the blood to be hypercoagulable (easier to form clots).  Cancer is one of the major causes blood thickening that results in clots in the veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and float to the lung.  Genetic causes for hypercoagulation are known to run in families.  Factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic causes of hypercoagulability occurring in 3-7% of the general population.  Other causes include Prothrombin 20210A, Lupus Anticoagulant, Protein C or S deficiency, etc.  These genetic diseases result in blood that clots more readily and can result in blood cloots in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and end up in the lung.

More rarer are diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn\u2019s disease.  Your gastrointestinal condition should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist who can properly test you for the conditions.  If you are indeed experiencing symptoms of diverticulitis (which is rare in someone of your age), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a colonoscopy to follow if there is suspicion of colonic pathology.

Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.  Researchers don\u2019t know the exact mechanism of the condition but believe it to be very slowly progressive in a step-wise fashion as patients generally experience years of latency followed by a gradual new onset muscle weakness and fatigue.  The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

Because of the added weight of the pregnancy women can expect to permanently grow in shoe size as well if they don\u2019t wear proper footwear.  The added weight can compress the ligaments of your feet and decrease the size of your arch.  Therefore, proper arch support is recommended to avoid compressive foot problems during pregnancy.

The most important work-up to determine the cause of stillbirth is an autopsy if it is offered and elected by the parents.  However, fetal karyotype studies should be considered in all cases to determine if a genetic disorder contributed to the stillbirth.  In addition, there are a number of maternal tests recommended to determine if the stillbirth was secondary to a maternal medical condition.  Women who have had prior c-sections are more likely to have birthing complications because of the increase potential for scarring in the uterus.

It is available over the counter in most states without a prescription (able to be filled by either males or females) but individuals under 17 may require a prescription.   After 120 hours, an implantable IUD device becomes the most effective form of emergency contraception.  These are usually offered by gynecologists. Sperm has a maximum life of 7-10 days within the female body so there is little risk of impregnation if you ovulate once every three months.  However, if you want peace of mind, you can take a pregnancy test about 35 days (28 day cycle + 7 days) after the date of unprotected intercourse. ",

In other words, trichomoniasis is defined as a sexually transmitted infection. Trichomoniasis is suspected in female patients with malodorous vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, or vulvar itching.  The standard tests include vaginal swab microscopy (which can visualize the organism 60-70%) and vaginal cultures (which can detect the organism 95% of the time).  Much rarer are PCR tests for trichomonas which can detect the organisms proteins 84% of the time. Therefore, it is possible to have tested negative for trichomonas and still have it.

Additional symptoms such as hot flashes, loss of libido, fatigue, and irritability would all point to the diagnosis of menopause.  The average age for menopause in modern women is approximately 50-52 years. By definition, a woman is menopausal if she has no menses for a period of 12 months and all other medical reasons have been excluded.  It is unlikely that birth control pills are contributing to your diminished periods unless you have recently changed pills.  Undergoing menopause at the age of 38 is not uncommon especially if there is a family history of early menopause (if your mother, aunts, sisters, grandmothers all had early menopause, then it is likely you will undergo early menopause).  However, you should be evaluated for medical causes of your decreasing periods.  Hormone levels fluctuate daily based on a variety of factors; they are a poor indicator of menopause and should not be used to diagnose menopause.  However, an ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial lining is often performed for anovulatory (not ovulating) women around the age of menopause or post-menopausal who are still having vaginal spotting or continuous vaginal bleeding.

      "body": "Based on your history, I don\u2019t see a reason why you would require fertility drugs at this time.  Unless there is a definitive reason to suspect anovulation or infertility, we recommend most patients your age to try to conceive naturally for 1 year before beginning an infertility workup. It might be beneficial for you to receive a medical work up and counseling from your gynecologist or a fertility expert.  This way, you may be informed on how recognize ovulation, how to time sexual intercourse with ovulation, and what you can do to maximize your fertility.  For your information, the first step in evaluating infertility is a semen analysis because nearly 50% of infertile couples are due to male infertility. With regards to your question, vitamins are beneficial to a healthy pregnancy; they supplement fertility treatments but do not replace them and there is no evidence of vitamins alone increasing your chance of pregnancy.  All women aiming to becoming pregnant should be on prenatal vitamins to prevent birth defects.  In addition, you should aim to make lifestyle changes such as eating a balanced diet, eliminating alcohol/caffeine/cigarettes, and maintaining a healthy sleep cycle.   With regards to herbal supplements, some people suggest that Chaste Tree Extract (Vitex agnus-castus) can help increase a woman\u2019s chance to becoming pregnant.  In fact, there is only scientific evidence that the extract is effective in decreasing PMS symptoms and breast pain.  There is extremely limited and inconclusive data that Vitex extract increases a woman\u2019s chance of pregnancy.  In fact, Vitex extract use is contraindicated during pregnancy.  We do not recommend anyone who is trying to conceive to use Vitex extract. ",

Im not sure what she told the doctors and if that played a part in the due date or if its based off of ultrasounds and hormone levels but the due date given was April 25, 2011 by her doctor. A due date of April 15, 2011 was given based on a couple unexpected trips to the hospital for spotting. They checked her hormone levels and did measurements of the sac by transvaginal ultrasound at the hospital on Aug. 24, 2010. At the hospital they couldn\u2019t see the baby until the following week but tried measuring the sac and said she was approximately 5 weeks and 1 day based on what they could gather and see. She was having sex with multiple guys around the same time period for a while now. When would she have most likely gotten pregnant?

The symptoms include pain and swelling attributed to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution. Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling. But if pain and swelling persists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil) are prescribed to decrease the swelling and pain. ",

Your body requires calcium to regulate its nerves and if you have low calcium, your body will break down bones to release calcium.  Electrolyte abnormalities such hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch as the nerves become \u201ctwitchy\u201d without the calcium or magnesium to stabilize it. Given your osteopenia, calcium supplementation is indicated.  There are other drugs such as bisphosphonates that may increase bone density in those who are osteopenic.  You should discuss your options with your doctor as well as discuss options to relieve joint pain.  Taking steroids long term is extremely damaging to the body and taking high dose ibuprofen will make you at high risk for stomach ulcers.

Nerve entrapments at the knee may also contribute to the pain.  Lastly, microfractures of the tibia (shin splints) can cause leg pain but this typically occurs in anterior aspect of the leg. For minor injuries, typical treatment requires 4-6 weeks of rest and NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) before gradually resuming low impact exercises (using an elliptical machine or swimming) while the injury heals \u2013 the stress of running or dancing can further exacerbate minor injuries.  Typically, patients presenting with your symptoms would be given conservative treatment regimens such as described above.  As the source of your problem appears to be at the area of the knee or ankle, a physical exam would be warranted to determine the cause of your problem if it persists or worsens despite conservative treatment.  In addition, MRI imaging of your knee and/or ankle joints might be useful to diagnose the problem. ",

      "body": "Given your history, the creaking knees appear to be a sign of bone misalignment resulting in cartilage wear known as patellofemoral syndrome.  If untreated, there can be excessive degeneration of cartilage between bones of the knee joints resulting in pain and swelling (chondromalacia) and eventually osteoarthritis.   Patellofemoral syndrome is a result of a misalignment of the knee joint (most commonly with the knee cap or patella) resulting in the cartilage of femur or tibia rubbing against the knee cap and causing the creaking noise you hear.  Patellofemoral syndrome is often caused by past injuries, overuse of the knee, or poor alignment of the muscles/bones around the knee.  As the knee joints bear most of the weight, the condition is exacerbated in overweight individuals. To treatment focuses on limiting the wear and tear on your knees.  You should decrease high-impact exercises and increase low impact exercises that are lighter on your knees.  Running on concrete, asphalt, or a treadmill can damage your knees so try using an elliptical, swimming, or doing yoga.  In addition, you should also look into supportive and adequately cushioned footwear that can lessen the impact transmitted to your knee.   ",

      "body": "There is a broad differential diagnosis for knee pain.  Important factors to consider is the onset, frequency, provocating factors, and intensity of the pain.  In addition, it is important to determine if the you have any history of trauma. Given you are 14 years old without any reports of trauma or additional symptoms (fever, other joint involvement, etc.), one of the most likely causes of your pain is Osgood-Schlatter Disease, otherwise known as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d  Osgood-Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in adolescents \u2013 estimated to affect up to 20%.  The symptoms include pain and swelling at the lateral-inferior side of the knee around the tibial tubercle (the bump below the knee cap on the right side of the right knee).  The disease is considered to be benign and is secondary to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution.  Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling.  But if pain and swelling persists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil) are prescribed to decrease the swelling and pain. As Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, acute and chronic pathologies should be ruled out by your primary care physician with a physical exam, X-ray imaging or MRI imaging. ",

      "body": "It sounds like you are having neuropathic pain affecting the left arm from the axilla to the fingers.  Seeing how you have had surgery on your neck, that appears to be the most likely culprit of your pain.  Based on your history, it is likely that your pain is caused by nerve impingement at the level of your cervical spine (the area of the spinal cord that\u2019s located in your neck). The location of your pain in relationship to your arm can localize the specific nerves that are impinged.  If your arm is numb around the area of your upper shoulder to your outer bicep and down to your thumb, it suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 5th or 6th cervical vertebrae.  Numbness affecting the back of your shoulder to the back of your elbow and down to your index and middle fingers suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 7th cervical vertebrae.  Finally, numbness at the area of your triceps to your ring and pinky finger suggests impingement of the nerves exiting your 8th cervical vertebrae or 1st thoracic vertebrae.  The information regarding where your pain is exactly located is important for your doctor to determine which level of your spinal cord is affected. If the pain is mild and there is no associated weakness in the arm, then pharmacotherapy with neurologic drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin) have been found to be very effective in controlling neuropathic pain.  Muscle relaxants have also been used with varied results.   If the pain is persistently moderate to severe, worsening, or associated with muscle weakness, then a detailed medical evaluation by your primary care physicial, a neurologist, or a spine specialist (orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon) with associated imaging such as an MRI of the cervical spine is warranted.  These symptoms suggest a serious problem which may result in serious, irreversible nerve damage and surgery might be indicated. ",

The gas then requires a few moments to redissolve into the fluid before the joint can be cracked again. ",

      "body": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease most often transmitted by the Ioxdes scapularis (otherwise known as the deer tick).  The risk of a tick-borne disease is negligible if the tick has not been attached.

If the tick is swollen with blood and attached for over 36 hours, then there is a 2% chance of transmission. There are two trains of though pertaining to Lyme disease.  Most physicians treat prophylactically with antibiotics (doxycycline), especially in high risk regions.  Some physicians tend to observe the patient and treat if any signs or symptoms of infection develop. Since you have bagged the tick, you should bring it to your physician for examination.  If your physician elects to wait and observe, then you should check your skin daily for erythema migrans \u2013 salmon colored rash with central clearing that is characterisitic of Lyme disease.  In addition, if you experience fevers, chills, facial droop, or other neurologic disorders, you should be evaluated immediately. ",

Some doctors believe there is an association between pectus excavatum and heart disorders but no link has been formally found.  No intervention is needed unless there is pulmonary or cardiac impairment. Lastly, pectus carinatum (also known as pigeon chest) is a deformity of the chest wall characterized by cartilage and boney overgrowth resulting in protrusion of the sterum and anterior aspect of the ribs.  Most cases are congential and either are observed at birth or are observed during puberty.  Pectus carinatum often results in decreased pulmonary and cardiac performance especially with strenuous exercise.  Treatment varies with severity but can involve bracing or surgery for severe cases.

Without the proper tests, it is difficult to say, but your reported history of a dropping blood pressure after onset of symptoms suggest that you are experiencing a parasympathetic dysautonomia.   In other words, it appears as if your parasympathetic nervous system is overwhelming your sympathetic nervous system.

From your question, there is certainly a chance you can impregnate your wife naturally if the only issue is a deletion of a portion of the Y chromosome.  Depending on your exact type of Y chromosome deletion and the extent of deletion, you may have either no decreased chance of impregnating your wife or you may have have a 50% reduction in impregnating your wife.  In the former, you would have normal daughters but your sons would also likely carry your Y chromosome deletion.  In the latter, we are assuming that your Y chromosome deletion has no impact on your X chromosome but the Y chromosome is incompatible with life.  Therefore you can only have daughters as only your sperm with X chromosomes are viable.  The remaining 50% of your sperm containing the mutated Y chromosome is incompatible with life. ",

Therefore, your first step is to re-evaluate your living situation and determine if you are re-infecting yourself.  The most common mode of transmission for helminths is fecal-oral so the fecal waste in your area must be disposed of properly.  Proper hand-hygiene is also necessary to prevent ingesting contaminated materials. In addition, drugs such as Vermox (mebendazole) should be taken properly.  For pinworm infections, the pill must be chewed and then swallowed with a repeat dose in two weeks to kill any remaining larvae.  For whipworm, hookworm, or roundworm infections, you must chew one pill for 5 days and then repeat the drug course in 3-4 weeks to kill any remaining larvae. Lastly, if these methods fail to control your worm infection, you should be evaluated for immunodeficiency.   ",

The most likely suspect in this situation is the thyroxine you are taking but it can also be a variety of other factors. In layman\u2019s terms, thyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone that is inactive until is broken down in the liver to produce active thyroid hormone T3.  The liver is also the source of triglycerides.  In some people, the process of breaking down thyroxine into T3 also releases triglycerides which may result in hypertriglyceridemia.  Other causes of hypertriglyceridemia include copper, calcium, or magnesium deficiencies, as well as estrogen therapy. Although a triglyceride level of 180 is not a desirable outcome, there is tremendous benefit in becoming euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone values).  However, you should follow your triglycerides and cholesterol closely and if they continue to rise, you may need to alter your medications.  ",

Sea Kelp contains high levels of iodine and may be recommended by some practitioners of alternative medicine for \u201cthyroid support.\u201d  It is not commonly prescribed by medical doctors and most doctors discourage taking iodine supplementation for individuals without iodine deficiency.  In terms of the physiologic need for iodine, seas kelp supplementation would ONLY be necessary if the person is actually deficient in iodine. Although every individual is different, the vast majority of patients prescribed Synthroid have hypothyroidism that is unrelated to iodine deficiency.  Therefore, chances are, sea kelp supplementation would not be beneficial and it is highly recommended that you continue taking Synthroid.

From what you are describing it appears as if you are suffering from the effects of a sinus infection. Sinuses are mucous membrane lined cavities within the bones of our face.  Normally sinuses produce mucous which drain into our nasal cavities and pharynx.  If the sinuses become clogged, bacteria can proliferate and cause an infection resulting in the symptoms of facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion/discharge, bad breath/taste, fever, headache, cough, etc. There is scant evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis and most doctors would advise against using antibiotics for routine cases of sinusitis.  The preferred method of treatment for sinusitis involves decreasing the sinus inflammation with nasal sprays such as Oxymetazoline (Afrin), oral decongestants such as Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). If your symptoms persist, you should be evaluated by a otolaryngologist (ENT) or have facial X-rays or a CT scan performed of your facial bones to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. ",

Nearly all cases of gout are chronic conditions that the patient will need to manage for the rest of his/her life.  If untreated, crystals can form in joints and the kidneys leading to arthritis/joint destruction as well as kidney failure.  People fall into three categories with regards to gout:\n1) The majority of patients are unable to adequately excrete the uric acid in urine.\n2) Some patients over-consume food rich in uric acid (red meat, alcohol, etc.)\n3) Lastly, there are patients who produce excessive amounts of uric acid. Treatment for gout involves dietary modification as well as pharmacotherapy with the goal to lower uric acid so that patients do not get acute gouty attacks.  Patients should eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet as well as limit their intake of red meat and beer.  Pharmacotherpay is the mainstay for gout therapy with drugs such as allopurino, probenecid, and colchicine being the most common drugs used. If you are still having gouty attacks, you should be evaluated by your primary care physician or rheumatologist to determine if your blood uric acid levels are still too high despite pharmacotherapy and if modifying the drugs you are on could help.

      "body": "Phlegm in the back of the throat is often a symptom of an underlying condition.  The most common causes of phlegm in the back of the throat include post nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and environmental exposure. Post nasal drip is a condition with excessive mucus production by the nasal mucosa which accumulates in the back of the nose or the throat.  Patients often report symptoms such as constant swallowing, frequent spitting, difficulty breathing, and coughing.  Post nasal drip is often caused by allergic rhinitis but it can also be caused by sinusitis or GERD.  Treatment includes antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, antibiotics for sinusitis, and proton pump inhibitors for GERD. GERD, also known as acid reflux, is a disease characterized by constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.  Patients often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation.  Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping.  Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. Lastly, environmental exposure can cause excessive phlegm production.  Smoking or second hand smoke is one of the most common cause of phlegm.  Other irritants or allergens such as pollen, mold, fumes, pet dander, etc. can also cause an increased production in phlegm.  Treatment involves identifying and eliminating the source. In your case, the likely culprits from your excessive phlegm include allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, gastric reflux, or an environmental exposure.  An evaluation by your doctor to identify possible causes of your phlegm production would include a physical exam and careful history.  If appropriate, antibiotics to treat an underlying infection, antihistamines to treat post nasal drip, or a trial of proton pump inhibitors to treat GERD might be indicated.   ",

Prolactin is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland in response to an infant\u2019s suckling and its primary purpose is to stimulate breast milk production.  As a side effect, prolactin inhibits sex hormones and is responsible for increasing irregularity or a complete loss of menstrual periods. Another factor that may be contributing to your loss of menstrual periods is the recent move from Dubai to India.  Stress is a major factor that can inhibit ovulation and menstruation. Given that your pregnancy tests have been negative, it is unlikely that you are pregnant.  In addition, you have had menstrual bleeding so a serious disorder with your pituitary gland is unlikely.  If you are breast feeding, your periods should return to normal in a few months after you stop.  If you continue to have menstrual irregularity in the coming months or cease to have periods, you should seek medical attention. ",

      "body": "Asbestos is considered to be benign as long as the material is not friable.  The United States EPA states that asbestos flooring in good condition is generally considered to be safe but the materials can become friable with age, or by sanding, grinding, or with demolition.  You would need to consult an licensed contractor that has experience working with asbestos tiles but in general, the Minnesota Department of Health has a great resource on residential removal of asbestos tiles: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/asbestos/floortile/index.html There is no amount of asbestos exposure that is considered to be safe.  Asbestos related diseases are dose-dependent with increased exposure resulting in a higher likelihood of disease \u2013 but not everyone gets sick.  In addition, the diseases have a latency period of 20-40 years from exposure to potential onset of disease.  Shipyard workers and construction workers with asbestos related diseases generally have been exposed high quantity of airborne asbestos for many years. In your case, removal of a basement full of asbestos containing tiles does not turn your home into a health hazard \u2013 especially if the tiles were in good shape and you didn\u2019t sand, grind, or demolish the stones.  While each person\u2019s susceptibility to disease is unique, there is a low chance of developing any asbestos related diseases from the minor construction you describe.   You should consult your family physician but from what you are describing, no medical testing is warranted at this time.  However, it may be beneficial, for peace of mind, to avoid using your basement until you test it for airborne asbestos and wash any potentially contaminated clothing/materials. ",

A 2003 article in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology studied 32,741 urine samples and isolated only 13 samples with Staphylococcus sciuri.  Of those 13 isolates, only one case of symptomatic urinary tract infection and five cases of asymptomatic bactiuria (greater than 100,000 colony forming units of the same species in a urine culture of a patient without symptoms) were established.  Therefore, the study concluded that Staphyloccoccus sciuri can be a pathogen: it is an extremely rare cause of urinary tract infection and can also cause asymptomatic bactiuria.  The bacteria is sensitive to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (Septra or Bactrim). ",

Stage 0 cancer is the earliest detectible form of cancer and it is limited to the most inner layer of the colon.  Stage IV cancer is the most advanced stage of cancer as the cancerous cells have spread to lymph nodes and at least one distant organ (Liver, Lungs, Bones, Brain, etc.). Treatment of cancer depends on the stage.  For early stage cancer, surgery is often offered and the goal of treatment is to cure the diease and elminate the cancer cells.  For late stage cancer, the goals shift from curative to palliative as the disease cannot be cured.  For late stage cancer patients, chemotherapy and/or surgery are offered to reduce pain/suffering and extend the life of the patient. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you are describing the symptom of hyperreflexia where patients twitch or have spastic tendencies especially when you are excited.   The numbness/tingling in your fingers is a normal physiologic reaction to excitement \u2013 some people are just more sensitive to it.  The explanation relates to the calcium balance.  When most people get excited, they tend to breathe faster causing them to excrete more CO2 from the blood.  This increases the pH of the blood making it more basic.  As your blood becomes more basic, the proteins in your blood develop a higher affinity to blood calcium and therefore decreases the amount of free calcium in the bood.  This in turn results in a pseudo-hypocalcium which most people experience as a tingling/twitching/numbness in the fingers, toes, or lips. Causes for hyperreflexia can also be due to drug side effects, electrolyte abnormalities or upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) disease. Drugs such as stimulants (some of the most common include those used to treat attention deficit disorder such as Ritalin) can cause hyperreflexia.  In addition, the side effects of certain classes of antipsychotic drugs can cause tremors. Electrolyte abnormalities such as true hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch.  Conversely, extremely high levels of calcium may also cause your muscles to twitch. Neurologic diseases such as those that cause upper motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (abbreviated ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), primary lateral sclerosis (abbreviated PLS), or pseudobulbar palsy.  Most of these diseases are progressive and the symptoms quite severe.  Therefore, with isolated finger numbness, it is unlikely you have these conditions. Although it is completely normal for you to feel numbness in your fingers when you are excited, it is more concerning if you have the numbness when not excited.  If the numbness persists or worsens, your primary doctor should perform a detailed physical exam as well as draw labs such as calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone levels.  If warranted a electromyogram may be performed to check the neuromuscular connections. ",

      "body": "When we age, our skin tends to sag normally due to gravity.  Dermal fillers (such as hyaluronic acid) can help prevent wrinkling of the skin but do little to improve the sagging.  In fact, some physicians suggest that dermal fillers may actually increase the rate of sagging by increasing the mass of the skin (if ever so slightly). There are few proven methods to prevent facial sagging and these include botox injections as well as face/eye lifts.  Facial exercises, such as facial yoga may exercise specific facial muscles not normally used but you should only expect minimal results. It is important to note that one of the only proven non-surgical methods of decreasing facial lines/wrinkles are vitamin A derivatives.  Tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), also known as Retin-A, is currently the only topical agent FDA-approved for the treating of wrinkles and furrows caused by prolonged sun damage.

      "body": "From what you are describing, it appears that you had an HIV ELISA test at an institution where they pricked your finger and sampled the blood directly from your finger with a micropipette instead of a capillary tube.  While technically improper, if the finger was properly sterilized and the lancet as well as the micropipette tip were both new and sterile, this does not put you at an elevated risk for contracting blood borne diseases such as HIV.  Micropipettes are set to draw up a specific volume into their tips.  When handled properly, no fluid should ever touch the micropipette itself \u2013 only the tip.  Therefore when the tip is disposed, any contaminant is eliminated as well.  Their technique, although unorthodox, does not appear to cross contaminate blood from one test subject to another from what you are describing. HIV tests are not performed on whole blood because the virus resides in the serum.  It is standard practice for blood taken from a patient to be spun in a centrifuge so the cells can be eliminated and the serum sampled for the test.  One can speculate that the person taking your blood with the micropipette ran the HIV ELISA test directly on the blood.  If this is the case, then there is a higher chance of a false negative (a person with HIV tests negative for HIV).  However, from what you are describing, there is no way of knowing if the institution spun the blood and performed the test on the serum or if they performed the test directly on the blood.  If this is an accredited institution for running HIV tests, then there is no reason not to trust the results of your exam. ",

Taking your reported number of sexual partners and assuming you are from New York, you probably had encounters with 75 people that were infected with genital herpes.

Genital Herpes is commonly caused by Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), although the oral version HSV-1 can also cause genital herpes.  Herpetic outbreaks cause painful genital sores and potential birth defects in women.  It is estimated that up to 80% of the infected population is asymptomatic. Using a condom doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent transmission of genital herpes as skin-on-skin contact can transmit the virus.

THC is the active ingredient in marijuana which reacts with cannabinoid receptors in the brain giving the user the typical \u201chigh.\u201d You are correct in that regular smoking of marijuana can be likened to regular smoking of cigarettes.  Note, however, one major difference between marijuana and cigarettes is that cigarettes are tightly controlled for quality of ingredients.  Marijuana is not regulated, and in addition, the lack of a filter leads to the user inhaling more carcinogenic agents produced by the burning of marijuana leaves.  There are many comparisons between marijuana and cigarettes available online if you are so interested. There are many studies showing that marijuana has carcinogens (up to 70% more than cigarettes) and irritants to the lung.  Lung tissue of marijuana users indicate a decrease in regenerative potential.  However, at the rate of 3 puffs per day, the chances of actually developing lung, throat, or esophageal cancer from Marijuana with even decades of smoking is slim to none.  But that being said, marijuana smoke still irritates the lung and increases the phlegm production as well as increases the user\u2019s risk of developing pneumonias. One recent study showed that marijuana users experience an increased heart rate as well as and increased chance of developing arrythmias and palpitations.  This results in an increased risk of developing a heart attack from using marijuana.  This risk is much greater in the elderly population than in the young population and much greater in those with pre-existing heart conditions.

      "body": "Parasitic infections are exceedingly rare in industrialized nations and are mostly found in third world countries that lack clean water, sterile food, etc.  Therefore, if you reside in an industrialized nation, there is no clinical indication for prophylactic treatment of parasites. There are many classes of parasites.  For the purpose of your question, we will simplify them into: 1) those that infect the intestinal tract (round worms, tape worms, etc), 2) those that infect the blood (malaria), 3) those that infect the genitourinary tract (schistosomes and trichomonas), and 4) those that infect the brain (naegleria). For intestinal parasites, your doctor can run a simple stool test for ova and parasites if you experience symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, etc.  The treatment for most intestinal worm infections is one to two doses of albendazole or mebendazole. For infections of the blood with parasites such as malaria, your doctor can obtain a blood smear to look for malaria if you experience symptoms such as cyclical fevers.  Malaria can be prevented by prophylactic drugs prior to travel to an endemic area but can also be treated once contracted and is rarely deadly once treatment is initiated. Genitourinary infections with schistosomes would produce bloody urine and trichomonas a frothy discharge.  Both of these can be tested for by your doctor if you have symptoms and both are readily treatable. Infections by naegleria fowleri are exceedingly rare but also rapidly fatal.  These infections primary occur in people swimming in warm, freshwater lakes where the parasite invades the human via the nasal canal.  There are a few treatment regimens available (such as amphotericin B) but the majority of infections lead to death.  There is no prophylaxis for this parasite. In summary, there is no reason for prophylactic treatment of parasites for individual without risk factors or exposure.  If any symptoms arise, your doctor can readily test for parasites and offer the appropriate treatment.  Furthermore, there exists no one way to \u201ccleanse\u201d your body of parasites as each class of parasite affects different organisms and the treatment regimen is unique for each parasite.

In addition, topical antifungal medications are the primarily line of treatment with topical antibacterial medications used as a second line. Your prescription of Methasiazone cream is not effective in treating the most common infections associated with balanitis as it is an antiviral cream that has been used in the past to treat topical viral infections.  The proper treatment for yeast-type balanitis includes miconazole or clotrimazole.  The proper treatment for bacterial-type balanitis includes topical bacitraicin ointment.  I would clarify with whoever wrote you the prescription or gave you the methasiazone cream what they are exactly treating for.   Perhaps you have a case of genital herpes causing cracking of your foreskin in which case, oral antivirals such as acyclovir or penciclovir are the standard of care. Whatever the case, visiting your primary care physician for clarification of your medication, diagnosis of your condition, and possible referral to a urologist for evaluation would be warranted ",

The most concerning of these symptoms is the sudden weight loss which could be secondary to a serious medical condition.   A sweet taste in the back of the mouth can be caused by medications, artificial sweeteners, dental issues, or medical conditions such as diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One condition that comes to mind that involves both sudden onset weight loss and a sweet taste in the back of the mouth is diabetes.  Excessive urination, excessive thirst, and sudden onset weight loss are all signs of diabetes and requires immediate medical attention. In your case, the most concerning issue is the sudden weight loss and sweet taste which may be an indication for uncontrolled diabetes.  This requires immediate medical attention by your primary care physician or a visit to the local emergency room without delay. ",

The most damaging effect of meth on dental hygiene due to its drying of the salivary glands.  Without saliva, acidic materials dissolve away tooth enamel.  Bacterial overgrowth occurs without saliva to keep the mouth flora in check resulting in gingivitis and cavities.  Methamphetamine also causes constriction of blood vessels in the oral and nasal cavities resulting in atrophy of the gums, nerve death, and loosening of the teeth.  Therefore, \u201cMeth Mouth\u201d is a result of toxic chemical residues irritating the mouth, decreased saliva production, and constriction of blood vessels. ",

Lastly, pectus carinatum (also known as pigeon chest) is a deformity of the chest wall characterized by cartilage and boney overgrowth resulting in protrusion of the sterum and anterior aspect of the ribs.  Most cases are congential and either are observed at birth or are observed during puberty.

In addition, it is important to determine if the you have any history of trauma. Given you are 14 years old without any reports of trauma or additional symptoms (fever, other joint involvement, etc.), one of the most likely causes of your pain is Osgood-Schlatter Disease, otherwise known as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d  Osgood-Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in adolescents \u2013 estimated to affect up to 20%.  The symptoms include pain and swelling at the lateral-inferior side of the knee around the tibial tubercle (the bump below the knee cap on the right side of the right knee).  The disease is considered to be benign and is secondary to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution.  Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling.  But if pain and swelling persists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil) are prescribed to decrease the swelling and pain. As Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, acute and chronic pathologies should be ruled out by your primary care physician with a physical exam, X-ray imaging or MRI imaging. ",

As a rapidly absorbed drug, alcohol is detectable in the blood within 15 minutes of production and in breast milk shortly afterwards.  Peak alcohol levels in milk occur anywhere from 30-90 minutes depending type of alcohol and whether it was taken with food.   Alcohol\u2019s affect on the nursing infant is determined by the quantity consumed, mother\u2019s drinking pattern, and time interval between alcohol consumption and nursing.   Even small amounts of alcohol consumed by the mother (1-2 drinks) can be a huge burden for infants because their immature liver cannot metabolize the alcohol burden.   Short term effects of alcohol include documented evidence that it can induce a drunken state in the infant.  In addition, alcohol affects infantile sleep and eating patterns \u2013 decreasing both sleep time and breast milk consumption.   In terms long-term effects on the baby\u2019s behavioral system and nutritional effects, alcohol is detrimental to both systems.  Alcohol has been found to hinder infantile development \u2013 babies of alcoholic mothers were smaller in stature and lagged in fine motor skills from their counterparts. Although no detectable effect was found on mental development, alcohol is still highly discouraged as the studies performed were not designed to detect such deficits.  According to the 2007 guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cBreastfeeding mothers should avoid the use of alcoholic beverages, because alcohol is concentrated in breast milk and its use can inhibit milk production. An occasional celebratory single, small alcoholic drink is acceptable, but breastfeeding should be avoided for 2 hours after the drink.\u201d ",

The bacteria is believed to have evolved resistance to the first few generations of antibiotics and is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections \u2013 especially in the immunocompromised or elderly.   People can have MRSA colonization or MRSA infections.  MRSA colonization is a result of having MRSA growing on your skin, nasal cavities, etc. without it causing the patient any undue stress \u2013 this is not an active infection.  A MRSA infection on the other hand is characterized by fever, chills, cough, sometimes pustules and pimples.  MRSA infections are life threatening and can potentially kill patients if untreated. It appears from your question that you are colonized with MRSA and are having sores appear under your arms.  To address the sores under your arms, one recommendation patients have found helpful is to avoid the use of antiperspirants and instead use only deodorants.  Antiperspirants can increase the chance of sores under your arms by preventing you from sweating and clogging your pores where bacteria can grow. MRSA rarely spreads and colonizes the blood in healthy patients \u2013 usually that occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, the very young, or the elderly.  Treatment for MRSA is now usually with vancomycin in those patients who require oral or IV antibiotics. The standard precautions to prevent spread of MRSA to others include standard hygiene techniques such as washing hands, covering your mouth when sneezing, cleaning surfaces and bathrooms and especially avoiding contact with infants, the elderly, or the immunocompromised.  Precautions differ based on your colonization status so you should check with your doctor. Signs that you have a serious infection include fever, chills, fatigue, etc.  Either way, you should be evaluated by your main doctor to see how bad your infection is and treatment options based on your infection status.

Patients with ADHD are easily distracted, have difficulty focusing, forgetful, and frequently jump from one task to another.  In addition, they may exhibit impulsive behavior such as nonstop talking and have difficulty being still and quiet.   easily distracted, miss details, forget things, and frequently switch from one activity to another.   To have a diagnosis of ADHD, the child must demonstrate impairment and inability to function in at least two of the following settings: playground, school, home, community, and social settings.   Children should also have other medical conditions ruled out such as chronic medical conditions, hearing/visual disability, anemia, hyperthyroidism, and heavy metal poisoning.   Patients with ADHD can be treated with pyschotherapy or pharmacotherapy.  With or without treatment, about 50-70% of pediatric patients have their ADHD resolve by adulthood. ",

The liver is also the source of triglycerides.  In some people, the process of breaking down thyroxine into T3 also releases triglycerides which may result in hypertriglyceridemia.  Other causes of hypertriglyceridemia include copper, calcium, or magnesium deficiencies, as well as estrogen therapy. Although a triglyceride level of 180 is not a desirable outcome, there is tremendous benefit in becoming euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone values).

      "body": "From your symptoms it appears that you are suffering from Orthostatic Hypotension \u2013 otherwise known as a \u201chead rush.\u201d  Orthostatic hypotension occurs when a person rises to a standing position from a lying or sitting position and is a result of falling blood pressure of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic with or without an increase in pulse rate.  The symptoms typically include dizziness, light-headedness, temporary blindness, body dissociation, extremity tingling, or even fainting.  These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow to the brain.    The most common causes of orthostatic hypotension can be divided into 3 catagories: Volume Depletion, Neurologic Abnormalities, and Medication.   Volume Depletion either from dehydration, anemia, or excessive fluid loss (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) can result in decreased intravascular volume and low blood pressure that can further be exacerbated by standing too fast.   Neurologic disorders can result in the inability of the body to constrict blood vessels in the leg as a person stands resulting in too much blood pooling in the legs and the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  Typically, this occurs in people with nerve damage, diabetes, dysautonomia, or other genetic/neurologic diseases.   Lastly, medications such as diuretics, antidepressants, or nerve blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension as part of their side effects.   It is not uncommon for people your age to suffer from orthostatic hypotension especially if you are in a growth spurt.  However, you should be evaluated by your primary doctor to see if there are any medical conditions contributing to your orthostatic hypotension. ",

People fall into three categories with regards to gout:\n1) The majority of patients are unable to adequately excrete the uric acid in urine.\n2) Some patients over-consume food rich in uric acid (red meat, alcohol, etc.)\n3) Lastly, there are patients who produce excessive amounts of uric acid. Treatment for gout involves dietary modification as well as pharmacotherapy with the goal to lower uric acid so that patients do not get acute gouty attacks.  Patients should eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet as well as limit their intake of red meat and beer.  Pharmacotherpay is the mainstay for gout therapy with drugs such as allopurino, probenecid, and colchicine being the most common drugs used. If you are still having gouty attacks, you should be evaluated by your primary care physician or rheumatologist to determine if your blood uric acid levels are still too high despite pharmacotherapy and if modifying the drugs you are on could help.

      "body": "Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by uncontrollable and/or excessive perspiration.  Common areas affected are the face, axillary regions, palms, groin, and soles of the feet.  It is believed that hyperhidrosis is caused by an increased activity of sympathetic nerve fibers \u2013 the same nerves responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response when a person is stressed.  Spicey foods, caffeine, and nicotine can also trigger hyperhidrosis in susceptible individuals. There are a number of treatments available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Your doctor prescribed you topical aluminum chloride which is often the first line treatment.  Anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin, benztropine, or glycopyrrolate can also used for their inhibition of normal nerve responses which may reduce perspiration.  However, these drugs have numerous side effects that may make them less desirable. Anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines are often prescribed to patients who sweat due to anxiety.  From your question, it appears as if you sweat mainly during the day \u2013 which is when most social situations occur \u2013 and return to normal at night.  This treatment method might be best suited for your symptoms. A more invasive procedure include Botox injections which can temporarily paralyze the nerves that innervate the sweat glands but this requires a trained professional, is mainly used for axillary sweating, and the effects only last for a few months. There are two main surgical techniques used to treat hyperhidrosis.  Direct sweat gland removal is a surgical procedure whereby the cosmetic surgeon directly removes the sweat glands.  This technique is almost exclusively used for axillary hyperhidrosis.  Another surgical technique involves removing or disabling the sympathetic nerve ganglion \u2013 known as a sympathectomy.  Although this is one of the more effective procedures, it also has the most serious side effects including permanent paralysis of nerves of the face, neck, and arms. ",

      "body": "There are a number of issues that can cause your pain.  Being that the pain starts at the lateral side of the knee and radiates to the ankle, it could be secondary to a ligamental injury.  A meniscal tear is a common injury occurring in athletes in which does not necessarily produce a popping or tearing sensation and the pain is typical of that injury.  Nerve entrapments at the knee may also contribute to the pain.  Lastly, microfractures of the tibia (shin splints) can cause leg pain but this typically occurs in anterior aspect of the leg. For minor injuries, typical treatment requires 4-6 weeks of rest and NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) before gradually resuming low impact exercises (using an elliptical machine or swimming) while the injury heals \u2013 the stress of running or dancing can further exacerbate minor injuries.  Typically, patients presenting with your symptoms would be given conservative treatment regimens such as described above.  As the source of your problem appears to be at the area of the knee or ankle, a physical exam would be warranted to determine the cause of your problem if it persists or worsens despite conservative treatment.  In addition, MRI imaging of your knee and/or ankle joints might be useful to diagnose the problem. ",

If the sinuses become clogged, bacteria can proliferate and cause an infection resulting in the symptoms of facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion/discharge, bad breath/taste, fever, headache, cough, etc. There is scant evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis and most doctors would advise against using antibiotics for routine cases of sinusitis.  The preferred method of treatment for sinusitis involves decreasing the sinus inflammation with nasal sprays such as Oxymetazoline (Afrin), oral decongestants such as Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).

Patients with Post Polio Syndrome experience gradually progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and fatigue.  Researchers don\u2019t know the exact mechanism of the condition but believe it to be very slowly progressive in a step-wise fashion as patients generally experience years of latency followed by a gradual new onset muscle weakness and fatigue.  The condition is generally not life threatening nor contagious but can significantly impact the patient\u2019s daily activities. Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Post Polio Syndrome but the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Therefore, your doctors must exclude other neuromuscular, endocrine, medical, and orthopedic conditions before settling on the diagnosis.   Three conditions, that should be ruled out, with symptoms similar to what you are describing are: Hypothyroidism, Myasthenia Gravis, and Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.  Hypothyroidism is a disease process where the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in the patient feeling increasingly sensitive to cold, depressed, constipated, and fatigued.  Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that results in increasing weakness of muscles with activity that improves with rest.  Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a condition where the neurons innervating muscle cells do not release enough neurotransmitting chemicals resulting in muscle weakness; it can be a result of autoimmune diseases or a syndrome associated with certain cancers.

In addition, it is important to determine if the you have any history of trauma. Given you are 14 years old without any reports of trauma or additional symptoms (fever, other joint involvement, etc.), one of the most likely causes of your pain is Osgood-Schlatter Disease, otherwise known as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d  Osgood-Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in adolescents \u2013 estimated to affect up to 20%.  The symptoms include pain and swelling at the lateral-inferior side of the knee around the tibial tubercle (the bump below the knee cap on the right side of the right knee).  The disease is considered to be benign and is secondary to the bone growth rate exceeding that of the muscle growth rate causing the tendons to be overstretched and inflamed. Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a self-limited condition that varies in intensity and can take anywhere from months to years for complete resolution.  Generally, no medications are needed and daily icing of the knee is sufficient to resolve the swelling.

Armour Thyroid is a porcine based thyroid hormone replacement used to treat hypothyroidism.  Thyroid medication and thyroid disorders can certainly affect your period.  In general, too much thyroid hormone can decrease the frequency of your periods or making your periods lighter. A deficit of thyroid hormone can lead to increased frequency of periods, heavier periods, and even an increase in the pain and discomfort of menstruation.  Dicontinuing thyroid hormone medication can certainly affect menstruation.  The affects are most likely temporary but it may take a few cycles before your periods normalize.  Meanwhile, the most common cause of missed period is pregnancy, therefore a pregnancy test is warranted if you have been sexually active. ",

      "body": "Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by uncontrollable and/or excessive perspiration.  Common areas affected are the face, axillary regions, palms, groin, and soles of the feet.  It is believed that hyperhidrosis is caused by an increased activity of sympathetic nerve fibers \u2013 the same nerves responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response when a person is stressed.  Spicey foods, caffeine, and nicotine can also trigger hyperhidrosis in susceptible individuals. There are a number of treatments available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Your doctor prescribed you topical aluminum chloride which is often the first line treatment.  Anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin, benztropine, or glycopyrrolate can also used for their inhibition of normal nerve responses which may reduce perspiration.  However, these drugs have numerous side effects that may make them less desirable. Anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines are often prescribed to patients who sweat due to anxiety.  From your question, it appears as if you sweat mainly during the day \u2013 which is when most social situations occur \u2013 and return to normal at night.  This treatment method might be best suited for your symptoms. A more invasive procedure include Botox injections which can temporarily paralyze the nerves that innervate the sweat glands but this requires a trained professional, is mainly used for axillary sweating, and the effects only last for a few months. There are two main surgical techniques used to treat hyperhidrosis.  Direct sweat gland removal is a surgical procedure whereby the cosmetic surgeon directly removes the sweat glands.  This technique is almost exclusively used for axillary hyperhidrosis.  Another surgical technique involves removing or disabling the sympathetic nerve ganglion \u2013 known as a sympathectomy.  Although this is one of the more effective procedures, it also has the most serious side effects including permanent paralysis of nerves of the face, neck, and arms. ",

However, certain stressors such as excessive exercise or dieting can decrease the frequency of your periods and even stop them altogether. Urine or blood hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) tests are routinely ordered 10 or more days after a missed period. The sensitivity of for over the counter urine hCG pregnancy tests varies between 90-97%. Blood hcg tests are more sensitive at 97-99% and they can actually quantify the amount of hCG circulating in the blood.

Of those 13 isolates, only one case of symptomatic urinary tract infection and five cases of asymptomatic bactiuria (greater than 100,000 colony forming units of the same species in a urine culture of a patient without symptoms) were established.  Therefore, the study concluded that Staphyloccoccus sciuri can be a pathogen: it is an extremely rare cause of urinary tract infection and can also cause asymptomatic bactiuria.

      "body": "It appears as if you are describing the symptom of hyperreflexia where patients twitch or have spastic tendencies especially when you are excited.   The numbness/tingling in your fingers is a normal physiologic reaction to excitement \u2013 some people are just more sensitive to it.  The explanation relates to the calcium balance.  When most people get excited, they tend to breathe faster causing them to excrete more CO2 from the blood.  This increases the pH of the blood making it more basic.  As your blood becomes more basic, the proteins in your blood develop a higher affinity to blood calcium and therefore decreases the amount of free calcium in the bood.  This in turn results in a pseudo-hypocalcium which most people experience as a tingling/twitching/numbness in the fingers, toes, or lips. Causes for hyperreflexia can also be due to drug side effects, electrolyte abnormalities or upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) disease. Drugs such as stimulants (some of the most common include those used to treat attention deficit disorder such as Ritalin) can cause hyperreflexia.  In addition, the side effects of certain classes of antipsychotic drugs can cause tremors. Electrolyte abnormalities such as true hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia (low calcium or low magnesium) can cause your muscles to twitch.  Conversely, extremely high levels of calcium may also cause your muscles to twitch. Neurologic diseases such as those that cause upper motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (abbreviated ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), primary lateral sclerosis (abbreviated PLS), or pseudobulbar palsy.  Most of these diseases are progressive and the symptoms quite severe.  Therefore, with isolated finger numbness, it is unlikely you have these conditions. Although it is completely normal for you to feel numbness in your fingers when you are excited, it is more concerning if you have the numbness when not excited.  If the numbness persists or worsens, your primary doctor should perform a detailed physical exam as well as draw labs such as calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone levels.  If warranted a electromyogram may be performed to check the neuromuscular connections. ",

With your symptoms three possible diagnoses come to mind: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction, or gallstones. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also known as acid reflux.  Patients suffer from constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus and often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation. Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping. Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. A hiatal hernia is a result of a portion of the stomach prolapsing up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.  Hiatal hernias cause patients to experience much of the same symptoms as GERD and may even contribute to GERD.  In addition, patients may report feeling full prematurely.  Most hiatal hernias do not require treatment.  However, surgery may be indicated in severe cases or if there are serious anatomic deformities resulting in inability to feed. Esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction is a broad spectrum of diseases that range from achalasia to autonomic dysfunction to diverticulae.  In short, the esophagus is unable to paralyzed (partially or completely) or there is a blind pouch in the esophagus and food becomes stuck leading the patient to feel as if something is stuck in their chest.  Treatments range from pharmacotherapy to surgery depending on the cause. Lastly, your burning and abdominal discomfort with eating may be related to gallstones (cholelithiasis) which produces painful colic in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Eating causes your gall bladder to contract and if there are stones present, it may cause a transient blockage of the gall bladder\u2019s sphincter.  The treatment is often with surgery to remove the gall bladder. In short, you should be evaluated by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  A physical exam is necessary to create a working differential diagnosis.  Tests such as pH monitoring, barium swallows, endoscopies, and right upper quandrant ultrasounds are especially helpful in diagnosing your condition. ",

Pretty much straight after this bleed, I had an accident on my leg which caused me to have multiple xrays and scans \u2013 I was asked if \u2018there is any chance you could be pregnant?\u2019 to which I answered no but it got me thinking again.

      "body": "With your reported medical history of TMJ (Temporomandibular joint disorder) diagnosed two years ago, it is likely that you are experiencing tension headaches \u2013 one of the most common forms of headaches.  Tension headaches occur in any age group but are most common among adolescents and adults.  These headaches are characterized by dull pressure in a tight band across the head often worst in the scalp, temples, back of neck, and shoulders.  The pain may be episodic, daily, weekly and last from 30 minutes to days. Tension headaches are believed to be muscular in origin and occur when the muscles in the scalp, temples, or neck contract or spasm \u2013 there is no structural brain abnormality.  Therefore, tension headaches can be caused by stress, anxiety, or head/neck trauma.  In your case, because of the distribution of pain, the tension headaches appear to be caused by your TMJ.  Other known triggers of tension headaches include: eye strain, dental problems (jaw clenching, teeth grinding), alcohol use, caffiene use, cold/flu, or sinus/ear infections. The first line of treatment is often with nonprescription NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen.  Relaxation techniques may also help decrease the headaches.  If NSAIDs and conservative treatment do not work, then second line treatments include: muscle relaxants or antidepressants (SSRIs or Tricyclics).  Headaches that worsen in nature, are associated with vision abnormalities, or induce nausea/vomiting are more serious in nature and require additional medical work up by a licensed professional.   In your case, it appears the headaches are being triggered by your TMJ and therefore you should explore options with your doctor to have that treated before exploring pharmacotherapy. ",

      "body": "MRSA is otherwise known as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.  The bacteria is believed to have evolved resistance to the first few generations of antibiotics and is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections \u2013 especially in the immunocompromised or elderly.   People can have MRSA colonization or MRSA infections.  MRSA colonization is a result of having MRSA growing on your skin, nasal cavities, etc. without it causing the patient any undue stress \u2013 this is not an active infection.  A MRSA infection on the other hand is characterized by fever, chills, cough, sometimes pustules and pimples.  MRSA infections are life threatening and can potentially kill patients if untreated. It appears from your question that you are colonized with MRSA and are having sores appear under your arms.  To address the sores under your arms, one recommendation patients have found helpful is to avoid the use of antiperspirants and instead use only deodorants.  Antiperspirants can increase the chance of sores under your arms by preventing you from sweating and clogging your pores where bacteria can grow. MRSA rarely spreads and colonizes the blood in healthy patients \u2013 usually that occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, the very young, or the elderly.  Treatment for MRSA is now usually with vancomycin in those patients who require oral or IV antibiotics. The standard precautions to prevent spread of MRSA to others include standard hygiene techniques such as washing hands, covering your mouth when sneezing, cleaning surfaces and bathrooms and especially avoiding contact with infants, the elderly, or the immunocompromised.  Precautions differ based on your colonization status so you should check with your doctor. Signs that you have a serious infection include fever, chills, fatigue, etc.  Either way, you should be evaluated by your main doctor to see how bad your infection is and treatment options based on your infection status.

It is available over the counter in most states without a prescription (able to be filled by either males or females) but individuals under 17 may require a prescription.   After 120 hours, an implantable IUD device becomes the most effective form of emergency contraception.  These are usually offered by gynecologists. Sperm has a maximum life of 7-10 days within the female body so there is little risk of impregnation if you ovulate once every three months.

I\u2019m worried if I leave it to long it will spread to my bladder or my urethra.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
      "body": "From your symptoms, it sounds as if you are suffering from chronic prostatitis but your urine cultures have been negative.  This can either indicate that you have either a chronic bacterial prostatitis or a chronic abacterial prostatitis.  To distinguish between the two, you will need to have your expressed prostatic secretions cultured (not just urine samples). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the diagnosis if the expressed prostatic secretions are positive for bacteria.  It has a reputation among urologists as being difficult to treat because of the persistence of bacteria within the prostate either because of poor drainage of prostatic fluids or reflux of urine into the prostate.  The standard treatments for bacterial prostatitis are fluoroquinolones like you mentioned such as Ciprofloxacin, Oxfloxacin, or Levofloxacin.  As an alternative Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is also prescribed twice a day for a four week course and may be especially effective in patients who experience side effects from the fluoroquinolones. Chronic abacterial prostatitis mimics the symptoms of chronic bacterial prostatitis except the expressed prostatic secretions are negative for bacteria.  In fact, the majority of chronic prostatitis \u2013 up to 90% of treated patients \u2013 are abacterial.  It is important to note a negative culture does not necessarily mean there are no organisms infecting the prostate but could indicate infection by a non-culturable organism such as chlamydia, trichomonas, gonorrhea, viruses, fungi, or other rare bacteria.  Autoimmune diseases and conditions can also cause abacterial prostatitis.  The initial treatment is either with a two week trial of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) or with a quinolone.  However, your urologist might add other drugs such as Flomax or finasteride to your treatment regimen. In your case, the proper algorithm to follow four weeks of unsuccessful antibiotics is a repeat expressed prostatic secretion analysis.  At this time, your urologist might elect to either perform more tests, put you on a full course of antibiotics, or put you on additional drugs if he determines that you have abacterial prostatitis.  I would keep the appointment with your urologist and if you are concerned about antibiotics, give him/her a call to ask for advice. ",

As a rapidly absorbed drug, alcohol is detectable in the blood within 15 minutes of production and in breast milk shortly afterwards.  Peak alcohol levels in milk occur anywhere from 30-90 minutes depending type of alcohol and whether it was taken with food.   Alcohol\u2019s affect on the nursing infant is determined by the quantity consumed, mother\u2019s drinking pattern, and time interval between alcohol consumption and nursing.   Even small amounts of alcohol consumed by the mother (1-2 drinks) can be a huge burden for infants because their immature liver cannot metabolize the alcohol burden.   Short term effects of alcohol include documented evidence that it can induce a drunken state in the infant.  In addition, alcohol affects infantile sleep and eating patterns \u2013 decreasing both sleep time and breast milk consumption.   In terms long-term effects on the baby\u2019s behavioral system and nutritional effects, alcohol is detrimental to both systems.  Alcohol has been found to hinder infantile development \u2013 babies of alcoholic mothers were smaller in stature and lagged in fine motor skills from their counterparts. Although no detectable effect was found on mental development, alcohol is still highly discouraged as the studies performed were not designed to detect such deficits.  According to the 2007 guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cBreastfeeding mothers should avoid the use of alcoholic beverages, because alcohol is concentrated in breast milk and its use can inhibit milk production.

Acne vulgaris is characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules on the face, upper chest, and back.  However as you are past the age of puberty and your acne appeared three months ago when you first started taking birth control pills (oral contraceptives), it is very likely that your acne is being caused by these birth control pills.

I hope the following  information regarding my symptoms and treatment will provide enough information to help with suggestions or recommendations about this condition.   At 16 I began developing inflamed red blotchy raised patches on my face. The rash originated on the sides of my chin and under my nose, and over time spread to my eyes and even into my nostrils. The rash was less inflamed in the mornings, but became increasingly inflamed as the day progressed.   The use of over the counter acne treatments (benzol peroxide products, astringents, etc.)  were ineffective and often further inflamed the rash. Following a year of unsuccessfully battling this condition, a family member offered me a tube of lotrizone.  The improvement was immediate. The rash disappeared in only a couple of days. The only problem; when I discontinued the cream, the condition quickly returned.   I did seek the help of the physician in our small town, but my doctor wasn\u2019t able to diagnose the condition, and continued to prescribe me lotrizone.   Two years later, I moved to a larger city, where I had the opportunity to visit a dermatologist. She instructed me to not use the cream for a week. Once the rash returned, she examined it and quickly diagnosed me with rosacea and an acne related infection. She prescribed 1000mg per day of tetracycline, and MetroGel for topical use.    The gel was harsh on my face and I only used it for a couple of days. However, the antibiotics worked and within a week of the month long antibiotic regiment, my skin had cleared.   Over the years, most often triggered by cold weather, the condition has flared, and a coarse of antibiotics is prescribed.   (A second dermatologist some years later, disagreed with the rosacea diagnosis, stating the condition was eczema. However, he prescribed the same treatment regimen of antibiotics / MetroGel. )  17 years later, I feel I\u2019m back at square one.  Over the last couple of years, the tetracycline has become ineffective, which is thought to be the result of having developing resistance to the medication. Doxycycline was prescribed, but due to an acute reaction, I had to discontinue use.  The antibitic \u2018Sulfa\u2019 was considered but rejected by my doctor due to dangerous side effects.   Following a recent visit to the MD, I am now taking a new class of antibiotic, (keflex \u2013 which was actually a recommendation made by a pharmacist following my severe reaction to the doxycycline ) and a Metro Cream instead of gel, which has proven less irritating to my skin. In addition to an oral antibiotic, the doctor suggested I mix a very small amount of lotrizone, (clotrimazole and betmethasone dipropionate Cream USP, 1%/0.5%) with the newly prescribed Metronidazole 0.75% and apply topically.   I \u2018initially\u2019 opted to not to mix the two, preferring to stop use of the topical steroid altogether. But after only two days of not using it, the inflammation returned, spread quickly, and my skin became sensitive to even the slightest touch.

Is it possible my skin has become addicted to the lotrizone? 2. If so, how do I wean myself off without having major flare ups? Can using increasingly milder steroid creams be a reasonable method of achieving this, or is the mixture recommended by my current MD a suitable option?   3. Does the use of lotrizone inhibit the effectiveness of an oral antibiotic by hiding or suppressing the symptoms?  4. Is there a way to reinforce my skins strength in areas where the lotrizine is being applied to thwart thinning skin?  5. Could resistance to the appropriate class of antibiotics mean I may have to resort to long term topical steroid treatment?   Despite many years of  repeat flare-ups, varied creams, and month long cycles of antibiotics, I have been fortunate to have not sustained any real, or at least visible, skin damage. When free of flare-ups, my skin is quite healthy and clear.  And at 35, I realize my skin may not continue to be as resilient as it has been. In addition to help with the questions  posed, I would welcome any suggestions or guidance on how to manage this recurring condition in a way that minimizes the negatives, like further antibiotic resistance and skin damage.   Thank You.",
      "body": "Lotrisone is a cream or lotion containing a mixture of clotrimazole (an antifungal) and betamethasone (a steroid).  It appears from your question that you were given the cream version.  This formulation contains a medium to high corticosteroid potency.  From your question, it appears that your skin clears up with lotrisone NOT because of the antifungal properties but rather the steroid.  It is certainly a possibility that, over time, your skin has become acclimated to the steroids and once you stop using the cream, you experience a flare in your rosacea. Dermatologists often attempt a steroid taper to wean patients off high potency steroids.  High potency steroids can weaken the skin resulting in fragile, sensitive skin.  Tapers are usually performed over weeks to months for chronic steroid cream users like yourself.  A typical taper involves your current regimen for 1 week, followed by a lower potency steroid cream for 1 week, and then the lowest potency steroid for 1 week.  We aim to prescribe our patients the lowest dose of steroids that controls their symptoms and this is often creams containing hydrocortisone (low potency) as opposed to betamethasone (medium to high potency). Just cutting back on steroids doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the symptoms.  We have had success in patients with rosacea by having them mix in some gentle facial lotion, such as Eucerin, that don\u2019t clog their pores.  In addition, we highly recommend daily lotions that contain an SPF of 15 to prevent sun damage.  This can effectively increase skin strength and prevent further damage from your steroid cream.   ",

      "body": "It appears that you have suffered from statin induced myopathy secondary to your simvastatin.  Statins are commonly prescribed to to treat hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and have a relatively low rate of side effects.  The most common side effects are muscle myopathies which range from an asymptomatic rise in creatine phosphokinase (a byproduct of muscle breakdown) to mild myalgia (muscle pain) to rhabdomyalysis (rapid, fulminant muscle breakdown).  Muscular side effects can be expected in 10 to 15% of statin users. The prognosis varies depending on the condition: a patient who has suffered statin induced rhabdomyalysis \u2013 a rapid, fulminant destruction of muscle tissue \u2013 will have a much longer recovery time than a patient suffering from statin induced myalgia.  Diagnosis of rhabdomyalsis includes an elevation in creatine phosphokinase, elevation in potassium, deterioration of kidney function, dark urine, as well as extreme weakness and muscle pain.  From what you are describing, it appears that you have a statin induced myalgia.  The overall prognosis of this condition is extremely favorable as long as it is recognized and treated promptly.   The first line of treatment is to discontinue the statin.  Secondly, adequate hydration must be maintained to prevent any kidney damage.  Recent trials have shown vitamin D therapy, for those deficient in vitamin D, to be effective in treating and aiding recovery from statin induced myopathy.  There have been clinical trials of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in patients with statin myopathy but the results have been inconcusive and there is no evidence to support its use to treat statin induced myopathy. In my experience, elderly patients who have had statin induced myopathy take anywhere from 3 months to over a year after stopping statins to recover from the muscle aches.  The most important factor in these patient\u2019s recovery is to resume as much of their daily activities and exercise as they can tolerate.  Bedrest is not advised, especially in the elderly, as it will deteriorate their muscles even further and further compromise their strength. ",

Shortly after, I had an ultrasound which was normal and was eventually told that I would probably need to use fertility drugs for some time before getting pregnant in the future.  Since then I have had to be on an oral contraceptive to maintain a monthly period. I am now 26 and married and wishing to get pregnant. I have been off of birth control for 5 months now and have been trying but not successful. Wondering if there is anything I can do before resorting to fertility drugs. Any herbs or vitamins that work?",
      "body": "Based on your history, I don\u2019t see a reason why you would require fertility drugs at this time.  Unless there is a definitive reason to suspect anovulation or infertility, we recommend most patients your age to try to conceive naturally for 1 year before beginning an infertility workup. It might be beneficial for you to receive a medical work up and counseling from your gynecologist or a fertility expert.  This way, you may be informed on how recognize ovulation, how to time sexual intercourse with ovulation, and what you can do to maximize your fertility.  For your information, the first step in evaluating infertility is a semen analysis because nearly 50% of infertile couples are due to male infertility. With regards to your question, vitamins are beneficial to a healthy pregnancy; they supplement fertility treatments but do not replace them and there is no evidence of vitamins alone increasing your chance of pregnancy.  All women aiming to becoming pregnant should be on prenatal vitamins to prevent birth defects.  In addition, you should aim to make lifestyle changes such as eating a balanced diet, eliminating alcohol/caffeine/cigarettes, and maintaining a healthy sleep cycle.   With regards to herbal supplements, some people suggest that Chaste Tree Extract (Vitex agnus-castus) can help increase a woman\u2019s chance to becoming pregnant.  In fact, there is only scientific evidence that the extract is effective in decreasing PMS symptoms and breast pain.  There is extremely limited and inconclusive data that Vitex extract increases a woman\u2019s chance of pregnancy.  In fact, Vitex extract use is contraindicated during pregnancy.  We do not recommend anyone who is trying to conceive to use Vitex extract. ",

Can you please help me to solve it out?",
      "body": "Phlegm in the back of the throat is often a symptom of an underlying condition.  The most common causes of phlegm in the back of the throat include post nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and environmental exposure. Post nasal drip is a condition with excessive mucus production by the nasal mucosa which accumulates in the back of the nose or the throat.  Patients often report symptoms such as constant swallowing, frequent spitting, difficulty breathing, and coughing.  Post nasal drip is often caused by allergic rhinitis but it can also be caused by sinusitis or GERD.  Treatment includes antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, antibiotics for sinusitis, and proton pump inhibitors for GERD. GERD, also known as acid reflux, is a disease characterized by constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.  Patients often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation.  Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping.  Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. Lastly, environmental exposure can cause excessive phlegm production.  Smoking or second hand smoke is one of the most common cause of phlegm.  Other irritants or allergens such as pollen, mold, fumes, pet dander, etc. can also cause an increased production in phlegm.  Treatment involves identifying and eliminating the source. In your case, the likely culprits from your excessive phlegm include allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, gastric reflux, or an environmental exposure.  An evaluation by your doctor to identify possible causes of your phlegm production would include a physical exam and careful history.  If appropriate, antibiotics to treat an underlying infection, antihistamines to treat post nasal drip, or a trial of proton pump inhibitors to treat GERD might be indicated.   ",

This has only been going on since Monday of last week.",
      "body": "The symptoms you are describing \u2013 burning sensation throughout the day in your hands and feet \u2013 appear to be either neurologic in nature or due to medication reaction with your phentermine.  Some people have adverse reactions when quitting smoking, but quitting smoking in itself has not been known to cause a burning sensation.  A burning sensation in the hands and feet could be an indication for a neuropathy.  Diabetic neuropathy, a result of uncontrolled blood sugar, will damage the nerves in the hands and feet and cause an intense burning.  This disorder is common among diabetics and can be screened for with blood glucose tests or hemoglobin A1C tests.  Other causes of burning sensations include vitamin A, B complex, and E deficiencies.  In addition, patients suffering from anxiety have also reported symptoms of \u201cburning\u201d in their limbs. Medication interactions, especially with phentermine, can occur and cause these symptoms.  A reaction known as \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d can occur when one takes certain antidepressants with phentermine and results in warmth/flushing, increased body temperature, fast heart rate, nausea, vomiting, or psychomotor agitation. These symptoms you are experiencing warrant a physical exam and blood tests by your primary care physician to evaluate the cause, especially since they have been occurring for about a week.  The physician can evaluate for any medication interaction, side effects of your current medications, or any new changes you might have started over the last few weeks that are contributing to your symptoms.

From what you are describing, enlarged, burning, and itching with a bump on the inner side of the thigh sounds as if it could be local irritation to the skin caused by shaving and resulting in a dermatitis. Other common causes of your symptoms are folliculitis or a yeast infection.  Folliculitis is a bacterial overgrowth of the sweat/hair follicles of your skin.  Shaving can predispose you to folliculitis as it can cause ingrown hairs and trap bacteria in the follicles.  A yeast infection is also common in the groin area and can present with a similar pattern \u2013 treatment with an antifungal, such as diflucan, can be effective in curing your condition. Your symptoms are unlikely to be from herpes as the vesicles are exquisitely painful with a tingling/burning sensation prior to the development of vesicles. However, a form of chlamydia known as \u201clymphogranuloma venereum\u201d (LGV) can also present in a similar pattern.  LGV is caused by the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and invades the lymphatic system causing swelling and irritation.  Initial presentation may be a painless genital ulcer 1-2 weeks after innoculation of the bacterial which resolves within a few days.  After the primary stage heals, the secondary stage can occur weeks to months later with the infection spreading from the skin to the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes resulting in swelling/redness/tenderness (most often only on one side), in the groin or inner thigh.  The disease can be screened for with standard STD tests but rarely negative test results may require a biopsy of the affected area to visualize the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria.  Treatment with the proper antibiotics such as erythromycin or doxycycline can cure the infection and resolve the symptoms. And to address your final concern regarding your hairs growing back double \u2026 that doesn\u2019t appear to make medical sense. If your symptoms worsen or do no resolve with your current treatment regimen, you need to consult a licensed physician to evaluate you and determine the cause. ",

      "body": "Parasitic infections are exceedingly rare in industrialized nations and are mostly found in third world countries that lack clean water, sterile food, etc.  Therefore, if you reside in an industrialized nation, there is no clinical indication for prophylactic treatment of parasites. There are many classes of parasites.  For the purpose of your question, we will simplify them into: 1) those that infect the intestinal tract (round worms, tape worms, etc), 2) those that infect the blood (malaria), 3) those that infect the genitourinary tract (schistosomes and trichomonas), and 4) those that infect the brain (naegleria). For intestinal parasites, your doctor can run a simple stool test for ova and parasites if you experience symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, etc.  The treatment for most intestinal worm infections is one to two doses of albendazole or mebendazole. For infections of the blood with parasites such as malaria, your doctor can obtain a blood smear to look for malaria if you experience symptoms such as cyclical fevers.  Malaria can be prevented by prophylactic drugs prior to travel to an endemic area but can also be treated once contracted and is rarely deadly once treatment is initiated. Genitourinary infections with schistosomes would produce bloody urine and trichomonas a frothy discharge.  Both of these can be tested for by your doctor if you have symptoms and both are readily treatable. Infections by naegleria fowleri are exceedingly rare but also rapidly fatal.  These infections primary occur in people swimming in warm, freshwater lakes where the parasite invades the human via the nasal canal.  There are a few treatment regimens available (such as amphotericin B) but the majority of infections lead to death.  There is no prophylaxis for this parasite. In summary, there is no reason for prophylactic treatment of parasites for individual without risk factors or exposure.  If any symptoms arise, your doctor can readily test for parasites and offer the appropriate treatment.  Furthermore, there exists no one way to \u201ccleanse\u201d your body of parasites as each class of parasite affects different organisms and the treatment regimen is unique for each parasite.  And regarding those online \u201cdetoxes\u201d or \u201ccleanses\u201d that promises to rid your body of parasites, there does not appear to be any medical evidence or legitimacy to support those claims.

      "body": "The condition you are describing is consistent with balanitis which is an inflammation of the penile foreskin secondary to smegma formation and yeast or bacterial infection under the foreskin.   Balanitis is more prevalent in uncircumcised men and men with poor personal hygiene.  The penile discharges are accumulate under the foreskin which results in smegma formation and can lead to yeast or bacterial overgrowth. The standard treatment for balanitis include daily retraction of the foreskin and washing the entire area with warm water and gentle soap.  Remember to replace the foreskin.  In addition, topical antifungal medications are the primarily line of treatment with topical antibacterial medications used as a second line. Your prescription of Methasiazone cream is not effective in treating the most common infections associated with balanitis as it is an antiviral cream that has been used in the past to treat topical viral infections.  The proper treatment for yeast-type balanitis includes miconazole or clotrimazole.  The proper treatment for bacterial-type balanitis includes topical bacitraicin ointment.  I would clarify with whoever wrote you the prescription or gave you the methasiazone cream what they are exactly treating for.   Perhaps you have a case of genital herpes causing cracking of your foreskin in which case, oral antivirals such as acyclovir or penciclovir are the standard of care. Whatever the case, visiting your primary care physician for clarification of your medication, diagnosis of your condition, and possible referral to a urologist for evaluation would be warranted ",

      "body": "Marijuana is the most commonly abused drug in the United States with estimates that 40-50% of Americans having tried marijuana at least once in their life.  THC is the active ingredient in marijuana which reacts with cannabinoid receptors in the brain giving the user the typical \u201chigh.\u201d You are correct in that regular smoking of marijuana can be likened to regular smoking of cigarettes.  Note, however, one major difference between marijuana and cigarettes is that cigarettes are tightly controlled for quality of ingredients.  Marijuana is not regulated, and in addition, the lack of a filter leads to the user inhaling more carcinogenic agents produced by the burning of marijuana leaves.  There are many comparisons between marijuana and cigarettes available online if you are so interested. There are many studies showing that marijuana has carcinogens (up to 70% more than cigarettes) and irritants to the lung.  Lung tissue of marijuana users indicate a decrease in regenerative potential.  However, at the rate of 3 puffs per day, the chances of actually developing lung, throat, or esophageal cancer from Marijuana with even decades of smoking is slim to none.  But that being said, marijuana smoke still irritates the lung and increases the phlegm production as well as increases the user\u2019s risk of developing pneumonias. One recent study showed that marijuana users experience an increased heart rate as well as and increased chance of developing arrythmias and palpitations.  This results in an increased risk of developing a heart attack from using marijuana.  This risk is much greater in the elderly population than in the young population and much greater in those with pre-existing heart conditions. Finally, there are studies that suggest marijuana is associated with mental conditions such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.  However, these are just associations and no cause-effect has ever been established. ",

Necrotizing fasciitis is suspected with a physical exam producing a crepitous sensation of the affected tissue (secondary to air pockets produced by the bacteria) and a radiographic evidence of air within the subcutaneous tissue. Necrotizing fasciitis is often caused by procedures that introduce bacteria from the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Typically, this includes breaks in the skin, injuries, insect bites, surgeries, injections, etc.  Diabetic patients and immunodeficient patients (HIV, cancer, etc.) are especially at risk because of a weakened immune system. As a survivor of necrotizing fasciitis, your risk of developing a re-infection is no greater than someone with your same risk factors who hasn\u2019t been previously infected.  Prevention of necrotizing fasciitis includes standard infection-prevention techniques such as proper sanitation, checking extremities for wounds (especially important for diabetics), proper glucose control, and avoid handling/eating undercooked or contaminated seafood or working with seawater/aquariums as it may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus \u2013 a bacteria associated with necrotizing fasciitis.

Nasolacrimal duct obstructions should be treated promptly to avoid any long term problems.  A proper work-up includes an evaluation by a qualified physician or opthalmologist before initiating treatment.  Imaging studies can be performed such as a CT-scan or X-rays with dye injection to visualize the duct architecture.  Treatment ranges from conservative to surgical and depends on the severity of your symptoms.  Typically, a warm compress applied to the affected corner of the eye for 20 minutes five times a day can open up the duct in mild cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

Though he was feeling fine, he went to the hospital as instructed.  At the hospital he was told that he had lost more than half his blood.  They gave him \u201c4 units\u201d.

When he went back to work 2 weeks later, they told him he needed the doctor to \u201cclear\u201d him for work before he could come back.  When he went to the doctor to get cleared, it was determined that he was still bleeding and that they now needed to do a cat scan to see why because the ulcers had been fixed.  A cat scan was taken.  When the results came back he was told that he had colon cancer and it was really bad, that it has spread outside the colon.  A couple of days later he went to get a colonoscopy.  At that time he told the doctor that over the last two weeks he was having severe pains in his abdomen.  The doctor told him that this type of cancer does not come with a lot of pain, so maybe he didn\u2019t have cancer after all\u2026 that maybe he had a ruptured appendix and what was actually on the cat scan was fluids from the ruptured appendix.  So the colonoscopy was cancelled because if they did that, then it could possibly kill him if he had a ruptured appendix.  He was given a 10-day prescription of antibiotics and an new appointment was scheduled for the colonoscopy in two weeks.  No additional tests or hospitalization was done at this point.  I was under the impression that a ruptured appendix would kill if not treated immediately by removal of the appendix, and I told him that.  He said that the doctor told him that it is possible, to survive a ruptured appendix.  So now he has me waiting two more weeks to see if he has colon cancer, or if he had a ruptured appendix.  This all sounds so crazy to me.

In your case, the d-dimer may have been elevated by pancreatic inflammation but it is difficult to say as the cyst may just be incidental.   The best test to rule out a blood clot in the lung is the CT Angiogram (which it appears you had).  A negative result rules out a blood clot in the lung.  With your CT scan being negative, it is highly unlikely that you have a blood clot in your lung. ",

Stage 0 cancer is the earliest detectible form of cancer and it is limited to the most inner layer of the colon.  Stage IV cancer is the most advanced stage of cancer as the cancerous cells have spread to lymph nodes and at least one distant organ (Liver, Lungs, Bones, Brain, etc.). Treatment of cancer depends on the stage.  For early stage cancer, surgery is often offered and the goal of treatment is to cure the diease and elminate the cancer cells.  For late stage cancer, the goals shift from curative to palliative as the disease cannot be cured.  For late stage cancer patients, chemotherapy and/or surgery are offered to reduce pain/suffering and extend the life of the patient. ",

Alternatively, a low dose short acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam can also be used 1-2 hours before speaking in public.  If the public speaking and presentations are regular, patients often adapt and long term pharmacotherapy is usually not necessary.\nIn addition to pharmacotherapy, patients have also been shown to benefit from psychotherapy which involves addressing the underlying issues that cause the specific phobias.

      "body": "Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by uncontrollable and/or excessive perspiration.  Common areas affected are the face, axillary regions, palms, groin, and soles of the feet.  It is believed that hyperhidrosis is caused by an increased activity of sympathetic nerve fibers \u2013 the same nerves responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response when a person is stressed.  Spicey foods, caffeine, and nicotine can also trigger hyperhidrosis in susceptible individuals. There are a number of treatments available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Your doctor prescribed you topical aluminum chloride which is often the first line treatment.  Anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin, benztropine, or glycopyrrolate can also used for their inhibition of normal nerve responses which may reduce perspiration.  However, these drugs have numerous side effects that may make them less desirable. Anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines are often prescribed to patients who sweat due to anxiety.  From your question, it appears as if you sweat mainly during the day \u2013 which is when most social situations occur \u2013 and return to normal at night.  This treatment method might be best suited for your symptoms. A more invasive procedure include Botox injections which can temporarily paralyze the nerves that innervate the sweat glands but this requires a trained professional, is mainly used for axillary sweating, and the effects only last for a few months. There are two main surgical techniques used to treat hyperhidrosis.  Direct sweat gland removal is a surgical procedure whereby the cosmetic surgeon directly removes the sweat glands.  This technique is almost exclusively used for axillary hyperhidrosis.  Another surgical technique involves removing or disabling the sympathetic nerve ganglion \u2013 known as a sympathectomy.  Although this is one of the more effective procedures, it also has the most serious side effects including permanent paralysis of nerves of the face, neck, and arms. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you have two major issues: family history of pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) and recurrent gastrointestinal pains. A family history of pulmonary emboli can mean there is either a family history of cancer or a genetic component that is causing the blood to be hypercoagulable (easier to form clots).  Cancer is one of the major causes blood thickening that results in clots in the veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and float to the lung.  Genetic causes for hypercoagulation are known to run in families.  Factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic causes of hypercoagulability occurring in 3-7% of the general population.  Other causes include Prothrombin 20210A, Lupus Anticoagulant, Protein C or S deficiency, etc.  These genetic diseases result in blood that clots more readily and can result in blood cloots in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis) which can break off and end up in the lung.  Blood tests can determine if you any clotting disorder \u2013 your d-dimer test appears to be normal given the clinical circumstance.  If your doctor suspect blood clots in the leg, a doppler study of the lower can visualize the veins. You second condition relates the the gastrointestinal tract.  Most common causes of abdominal pain in young females include ovulatory pains, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or food allergies (including lactose intolerance).  More rarer are diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn\u2019s disease.  Your gastrointestinal condition should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist who can properly test you for the conditions.  If you are indeed experiencing symptoms of diverticulitis (which is rare in someone of your age), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a colonoscopy to follow if there is suspicion of colonic pathology. In the end, if your doctor is blowing you off and does not seem interested in diagnosing your condition, it might be time to search for a new one. ",

      "body": "It appears as if you are having gastrointestinal issues which requires professional evaluation by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  With your symptoms three possible diagnoses come to mind: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction, or gallstones. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also known as acid reflux.  Patients suffer from constant reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus and often report symptoms of heartburn, sour taste at the back of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, excessive phlegm, or excessive salivation. Symptoms are often exacerbated by reclining or at night when sleeping. Treatment often includes medication that reducing acid production in the stomach thereby decreasing the amount refluxed. A hiatal hernia is a result of a portion of the stomach prolapsing up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.  Hiatal hernias cause patients to experience much of the same symptoms as GERD and may even contribute to GERD.  In addition, patients may report feeling full prematurely.  Most hiatal hernias do not require treatment.  However, surgery may be indicated in severe cases or if there are serious anatomic deformities resulting in inability to feed. Esophageal dysmotility/dysfunction is a broad spectrum of diseases that range from achalasia to autonomic dysfunction to diverticulae.  In short, the esophagus is unable to paralyzed (partially or completely) or there is a blind pouch in the esophagus and food becomes stuck leading the patient to feel as if something is stuck in their chest.  Treatments range from pharmacotherapy to surgery depending on the cause. Lastly, your burning and abdominal discomfort with eating may be related to gallstones (cholelithiasis) which produces painful colic in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Eating causes your gall bladder to contract and if there are stones present, it may cause a transient blockage of the gall bladder\u2019s sphincter.  The treatment is often with surgery to remove the gall bladder. In short, you should be evaluated by either your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist.  A physical exam is necessary to create a working differential diagnosis.  Tests such as pH monitoring, barium swallows, endoscopies, and right upper quandrant ultrasounds are especially helpful in diagnosing your condition. ",

Previous abdominal surgeries (appendectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy etc) can result in bowel adhesions that obstruct forward flow.  Ulcers can irritate the gastrointestinal tract decreasing motility.  Masses and tumors can mechanically obstruct the forward flow.  And neuropathies such as those associated with diabetes can damage gastrointestinal nerves and result in improper/absent motility.  If the symptoms have a clear provocation (such as gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and diarrhea) and resolve on their own without sequelae then no medical intervention is needed.  However, if these symptoms have been occurred before without an identifiable cause, you have a prior history of abdominal surgery, the symptoms do no improve, you are not passing gas, or you start vomiting, then prompt medical attention is needed.  Studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast can usually localize the site of the obstruction and identify any structural abnormality. ",

      "body": "Freezing a foot from the ankle down to remove a foreign object such as a toothpick is not standard practice.  In fact, most emergency room physicians, surgeons, and primary care physicians numb the area with lidocaine and then remove the tooth pick.  A tetanus shot is given if the patient requires a booster. I don\u2019t know exactly what freezing solution you are referring to, but there is a serious risk of nerve, vascular, muscular and soft tissue damage from freezing the foot.  Therefore, with the symptoms you are experiencing, you should be evaluated immediately by a qualified physician. ",

      "header": "About three months ago I was diagnosed with a case of acute bacterial prostatitis.  I was put on a four week course of ofloxacin.  My urine samples were negative for bacteria but from what i understand, this is common for prostatitis sufferers.  I have recently been experiencing some discharge after urination.  No real burning, or blood in urine, but a weak stream and the same lower back pain that I experienced the first time around.  Should I go back to get examined even though I have my appt with a urologist in about a week and a half?  I would like to be antibiotic free in case the uro wants a sample of prostatic fluid for culture.  I\u2019m afraid just because of the history they\u2019ll stick my on another long course of quinolones (which by the way caused major pain in my hips after long term use)  Are there other anti-microbials that are as effective as quinolones.  I\u2019m worried if I leave it to long it will spread to my bladder or my urethra.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
      "body": "From your symptoms, it sounds as if you are suffering from chronic prostatitis but your urine cultures have been negative.  This can either indicate that you have either a chronic bacterial prostatitis or a chronic abacterial prostatitis.  To distinguish between the two, you will need to have your expressed prostatic secretions cultured (not just urine samples). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the diagnosis if the expressed prostatic secretions are positive for bacteria.  It has a reputation among urologists as being difficult to treat because of the persistence of bacteria within the prostate either because of poor drainage of prostatic fluids or reflux of urine into the prostate.  The standard treatments for bacterial prostatitis are fluoroquinolones like you mentioned such as Ciprofloxacin, Oxfloxacin, or Levofloxacin.  As an alternative Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is also prescribed twice a day for a four week course and may be especially effective in patients who experience side effects from the fluoroquinolones. Chronic abacterial prostatitis mimics the symptoms of chronic bacterial prostatitis except the expressed prostatic secretions are negative for bacteria.  In fact, the majority of chronic prostatitis \u2013 up to 90% of treated patients \u2013 are abacterial.  It is important to note a negative culture does not necessarily mean there are no organisms infecting the prostate but could indicate infection by a non-culturable organism such as chlamydia, trichomonas, gonorrhea, viruses, fungi, or other rare bacteria.  Autoimmune diseases and conditions can also cause abacterial prostatitis.  The initial treatment is either with a two week trial of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) or with a quinolone.  However, your urologist might add other drugs such as Flomax or finasteride to your treatment regimen. In your case, the proper algorithm to follow four weeks of unsuccessful antibiotics is a repeat expressed prostatic secretion analysis.  At this time, your urologist might elect to either perform more tests, put you on a full course of antibiotics, or put you on additional drugs if he determines that you have abacterial prostatitis.  I would keep the appointment with your urologist and if you are concerned about antibiotics, give him/her a call to ask for advice. ",

      "header": "My question concerns plastic surgery for the face. Will repeated dermal hyaluronic collagen fillers cause more sagging of the skin when the injections cease? Would it be better to leave the skin alone? And will repeated injections over the years as it is required every 9 months cause the patient to eventually require face lifts? If the patient does not like non invasive procedures would you recommend that the face be left alone? Lastly, do yoga exercises for facial suppleness really work? They promise to decrease nasal labial lines. Is this true or a gimmick? Thanks.",
      "body": "When we age, our skin tends to sag normally due to gravity.  Dermal fillers (such as hyaluronic acid) can help prevent wrinkling of the skin but do little to improve the sagging.  In fact, some physicians suggest that dermal fillers may actually increase the rate of sagging by increasing the mass of the skin (if ever so slightly). There are few proven methods to prevent facial sagging and these include botox injections as well as face/eye lifts.  Facial exercises, such as facial yoga may exercise specific facial muscles not normally used but you should only expect minimal results. It is important to note that one of the only proven non-surgical methods of decreasing facial lines/wrinkles are vitamin A derivatives.  Tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), also known as Retin-A, is currently the only topical agent FDA-approved for the treating of wrinkles and furrows caused by prolonged sun damage. Retinol and Tazarotene are also vitamin A derivatives becoming more widely used in topical creams and studies have shown they can also decrease wrinkles in the skin. ",

      "body": "Isolated arm numbness can be benign or a symptom of an underlying decision.  That you are experiencing it in both your arms suggests a systemic or neurologic cause as opposed to local trauma.  However, common things being common, carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression are common causes of arm pain.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by repetitive wrist movements, such as typing, that cause stress to the tendons and nerves in the wrist.  Ulnar nerve compression is often caused by people who lean on their elbows or rest their forearms on the edge of their table.  This can result in arm pain and numbness that radiates from the forearm to the ring and little finger.\nWith local trauma ruled out, the likely culprits can be divided into endocrine diseases, neurologic diseases, cardiac/vascular disease, or vitamin deficiencies.\nRegarding endocrine diseases, diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy where your limbs become numb secondary to nerve death.  However, peripheral neuropathy usually starts affecting the lower extremities first.  Your doctor can screen for diabetes by measuring your blood sugar.\nNeurologic diseases such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathies, and spinal cord diseases can also cause bilateral arm pain.  The likely culprits can be ruled out with a neurologic exam supplemented with x-rays and/or MRI as well as blood tests for syphillis.\nArm pain can also be a sign of arterial insufficiency or cardiac problems such as angina where chest pain is often referred to the arm.\nFinally, as you mentioned that you get arm pain while drinking, vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and Thiamine can cause peripheral nerve problems.\nBecause your symptoms are increasing in frequency, a full medical workup is warranted by your medical doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause.
