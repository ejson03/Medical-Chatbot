    "answer": "you would like to know whether someone with hypoglycemia can live on a vegetarian diet. a vegetarian diet is a diet or lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food. properly planned vegan diets are healthful and have been found to satisfy nutritional needs. poorly planned vegan diets can be low in levels of calcium iodine vitamin b12 and vitamin d. vegans are therefore encouraged to plan their diet and take dietary supplements such as vitamin b12 vitamin d calcium iodine and omega-3 fatty acids. these deficiencies have potentially serious consequences including anemia rickets and cretinism in children and osteomalacia and hypothyroidism in adults. given the data that you provided of hypoglycemia hunger blurred vision of your left eye and weight loss it is likely that you experience them because your body is not adjusting to that diet and the low calorie intake. since you experience thyroid cancer the needs for energy are increased because the cancer causes the metabolism to work faster and to spend the energy faster. if the body doesn't have enough energy it starts to lose in weight and hypoglycemia is the consequence. you may consider changing the diet back to normal or to increase the energy intake while still vegetarian but to take more vitamin mineral and omega-3 fatty acids supplements. please keep in mind that i provide medical information only. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please contact your doctor or other healthcare provider such as nutritionist for further advice and information.",

    "answer": "hello and welcome to ehealth forum! this is a personal and religious decision but considering the circumstances it is best to opt for abortion. otherwise you need to inform your parents about it. the best way to do is go for a dilatation and curettage. vacuum evacuation can be tried before 7 weeks of pregnancy. if you do not want that then you can try a drug which contains a chemical called mifepristone. the best method through pills is a combination of mifepristone plus prostaglandin. discuss this with the gynecologist. i would suggest you consult a gynecologist if your pregnancy test is positive and not go for any pills on your own as they carry the danger of incomplete abortion and very heavy bleeding. a dose higher than the required dose can cause damage to the uterus too. so please do not self medicate. after the termination think in terms of inserting iud or other such devices like implanon or go for pills. please consult your gynecologist. hope this helps. take care!",

    "answer": "babies have received the immunity from the mother when they were still in the womb. this protects the baby in the first six months of its life. however this makes the baby susceptible to viruses and bacteria at the same rate as the mother. when you take the baby to a doctor a physical examination of the nose the throat and the lungs would be done. laboratory tests needed to detect the exact cause of the infection are likely to be performed too. since a common cold is usually caused by a virus the doctor might decide not to prescribe antibiotics and instead opt to wait and see. if the baby has a fever antipyretics would be recommended. if a bacterial cause is detected then adequate antibiotics would be given. the only specific thing about this is that not all antibiotics are recommended for babies. but do not worry. a -pediatrician whom you are advised would know what antibiotic is allowed to be given to your baby. a pump to take out the fluid from the nose would ease the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breathing. this would also help the baby to eat because a running nose might make the breastfeeding more difficult because the baby would keep gasping for air.",

    "answer": "thank you for your question on ehealthforum. com dysmenorrhea (pain during periods) associated with back ache is common in some women especially young women in their initial years of sexual life. meningitis can produce headache due to interference with cerebrospinal fluid circulation by altering the intracranial pressures. if your meningitis was uncomplicated with no csf blockage it is unlikely to cause any problems. neurological examination will help in identifying any sequelae of meningitis suffered earlier. eye examination will show signs of increased intracranial pressure like optic disc edema. in an instance of raised intracranial pressure person suffers from headache (chronic) visual disturbance and even loss apart from other neurological symptoms depending on pressure related damage. if you do not have any of those mentioned than it is very unlikely that you have any symptoms related to meningitis sequelae. thank you.",

    "answer": "hair loss (alopecia) is a disorder in which the hair falls out from skin areas where it is usually present such as the scalp and body. hair loss can be caused due to multiple factors including genetic factors diet endocrine abnormalities systemic illnesses drug intake and hair shaft abnormalities. in your case since you are having generalised hair thinning on your scalp without any bald spots you may be having androgenetic alopecia or trichodystrophy. treatment of androgenetic alopecia can be done with topical medications like minoxidil or finasteride. conditions that result in trichodystrophy and fragile hair can include exposure to excessive sunlight hair care techniques (such as hot combing and blow drying) and chemical processes (including coloring straightening and perming). avoiding such procedures or sunlight exposure should be the main stay. gentle hair care and use of hair shampoos and conditioners (leave on) can help prevent further damage. regrowth of hair can occur within few months provided repeated damage does not occur. it would be recommended that you consult a dermatologist or a hair specialist and seek additional guidance and proper advice for proper hair care. i hope this helps.",

    "answer": "you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child's movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child's ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the patterns of movement the child presents with; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the child's present capabilities; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 examination of the child's posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized 'problem-solving' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of 'key points' on the child's body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.",

    "answer": "it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called 'nissen fundoplication'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery 'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.",

    "question": "i think i might be dyslexic. what do i do? my dad is dyslexic i have trouble spelling i always jumble the letters together. i have trouble with sentence structure too. one of my english teachers asked if i'd ever been tested for anything. i had a tutor once who told my parents she thought i had short term memory loss. i have trouble with money in math and patterning. it just doesn't process it my mine it's like there's a wall. when reading aloud i don't properly process what i reading and i can't focus on the words. so sometimes i say something completely different then what's on the page. i also can't recognize words when reading and need to hear them a few times to know them. when reading an exert for class work i always finish later then others. because it wont process in my mind and i have to keep reading it. i get that when reading books too i'll have to read a sentence over to make it process. and when speaking sometimes my words get a jumbled. does this sound like dyslexia?",

    "answer": "hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post is not intended to give or rule out a diagnosis create a doctor-patient relationship or replace an existing one. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment options)",
    "question": "i constantly have bursts of anger for no reason once it's over i usually wish i wouldn't have done it and go from being absolutely angry and freaking out to completely calm. my father is the same way i have constant anxiety and i'm almost never completely happy about something. my moods are all over the place but the most dominating and often reoccurring is anger i literally wake up in the morning angry for no reason. i was never like this before i hit about 14 i just turned 21 and it seems to be getting increasingly worse. it just feels like i'm someone else completely when it's happening an i just don't feel like i can stop no matter who i'm taking it out on then i snap out of it after it finally exhaust's me and it's just almost like it was a different person acting that way. i don't have the money to go to the doctor and i don't have insurance. i feel like i can't handle this emotional roller-coaster anymore. does this classify under bipolar and if so what type?",

    "question": "hello i'm 20 years old and i've always seemed to have almost random outbursts of anger. i first started this when i was in 1st grade where i would have 1-2 hour bursts of anger followed by a long fit of crying. i would completely freak out and start trying to injure myself start shouting resisting people trying to calm me etc. it would be quite frequent (at least once a week) and would continue up until the end of 6th grade where after 6th grade i thought it was gone for good. until i had an episode when i was a sophomore in high school when walking around with friends. it was the same as before punching a stone wall shouting incoherently the exact same type of thing. after that i usually have an episode about one time every year sometimes two. sometimes i'll also feel very depressed for about 1-2 hours as well with it just ending almost abruptly. i've always absolutely hated what this is and i want to have an idea of what is going on. thanks for reading.",
