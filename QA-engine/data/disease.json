      "description": "Jaundice is a term used to describe a yellowish tinge to the skin and the whites of the eye. Body fluids may also be yellow.The color of the skin and whites of the eyes will vary depending on levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a waste material found in the blood. Moderate levels lead to a yellow color, while very high levels will appear brown.An inflamed liver or obstructed bile duct can lead to jaundice, as well as other underlying conditions.Underlying conditions that may cause jaundice include:Acute inflammation of the liver: This may impair the ability of the liver to conjugate and secrete bilirubin, resulting in a buildup.Inflammation of the bile duct: This can prevent the secretion of bile and removal of bilirubin, causing jaundice.Obstruction of the bile duct: This prevents the liver from disposing of bilirubin.Hemolytic anemia: The production of bilirubin increases when large quantities of red blood cells are broken down.Gilbert's syndrome: This is an inherited condition that impairs the ability of enzymes to process the excretion of bile.Cholestasis: This interrupts the flow of bile from the liver. The bile containing conjugated bilirubin remains in the liver instead of being excreted.Diagnosis:The yellowing of skin and eyes are likely to be the main clues a doctor will use before confirming a jaundice diagnosis.A physical examination will be carried out to look for signs of swelling of the liver and legs, ankles or feet, which might indicate cirrhosis of the liver.",
      "treatment": "Jaundice is treated by managing the underlying cause.Medication:Medication or supplements can help jaundice depending on the cause.Treatment will depend on the underlying cause.Jaundice treatment targets the cause rather than the jaundice symptoms.The following treatments are used:Anemia-induced jaundice may be treated by boosting the amount of iron in the blood by either taking iron supplements or eating more iron-rich foods.Hepatitis-induced jaundice requires antiviral or steroid medications.Doctors can treat obstruction-induced jaundice by surgically removing the obstruction.If the jaundice has been caused by use of a medication, treatment for involves changing to an alternative medication.",

The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis.Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. When the cartilage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the slick, cushioning surface on the ends of bones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wears away, bone rubs against bone, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Over time, joints can lose strength and pain may become chronic. Risk factors include excess weight, family history, age and previous injury (an anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, tear, for example). Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues.Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity.The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well.

Commonly used arthritis medications include:Analgesics. These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation, and some may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints.TherapyPhysical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.SurgeryIf conservative measures don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as:Joint repair. In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically \u00e2\u20ac\u201d through small incisions over the joint.Joint replacement. This procedure removes your damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.Joint fusion. This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit.",

The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.Many strains of tuberculosis resist the drugs most used to treat the disease. People with active tuberculosis must take several types of medications for many months to eradicate the infection and prevent development of antibiotic resistance.Although your body may harbor the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, your immune system usually can prevent you from becoming sick. For this reason, doctors make a distinction between:Latent TB. In this condition, you have a TB infection, but the bacteria remain in your body in an inactive state and cause no symptoms. Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious. It can turn into active TB, so treatment is important for the person with latent TB and to help control the spread of TB. An estimated 2 billion people have latent TB.Active TB. This condition makes you sick and can spread to others. It can occur in the first few weeks after infection with the TB bacteria, or it might occur years later.Although tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch. You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger. Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious.The most commonly used diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is a simple skin test, though blood tests are becoming more commonplace. A small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin is injected just below the skin of your inside forearm. You should feel only a slight needle prick.Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you're likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant.",

It produces tetraiodothyronine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are two primary hormones that control how your cells use energy. Your thyroid gland regulates your metabolism through the release of these hormones.Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid makes too much T4, T3, or both. Diagnosis of overactive thyroid and treatment of the underlying cause can relieve symptoms and prevent complications.A variety of conditions can cause hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It causes antibodies to stimulate the thyroid to secrete too much hormone. Graves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 disease occurs more often in women than in men. It tends to run in families, which suggests a genetic link. You should tell your doctor if your relatives have had the condition.Other causes of hyperthyroidism include:Excess iodine, a key ingredient in T4 and T3Thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid, which causes T4 and T3 to leak out of the glandTumors of the ovaries or testesBenign tumors of the thyroid or pituitary glandLarge amounts of tetraiodothyronine taken through dietary supplements or medicationDiagnosis:Cholesterol testT4, free T4, T3 testsThyroid stimulating hormone level testTriglyceride testThyroid scan and uptakeUltrasoundCT or MRI scansRadio Iodine Uptake testPhysical ExamBlood TestsChecking for weight lossChecking for protruding eyesChecking for enlarged thyroid gland",

Because this treatment causes thyroid activity to slow considerably, causing the thyroid gland to be underactive (hypothyroidism), you may eventually need to take medication every day to replace thyroxine.Anti-thyroid medications. These medications gradually reduce symptoms of hyperthyroidism by preventing thyroid gland from producing excess amounts of hormones. They include propylthiouracil and methimazole (Tapazole).

The longer it is left, the more serious heatstroke can become.

This type of heatstroke typically occurs after exposure to hot, humid weather, especially for prolonged periods. It occurs most often in older adults and in people with chronic illness.Strenuous activity. Exertional heatstroke is caused by an increase in core body temperature brought on by intense physical activity in hot weather.Anyone exercising or working in hot weather can get exertional heatstroke, but it's most likely to occur if you're not used to high temperatures.",
      "treatment": "Prevention:Heatstroke is predictable and preventable. Wearing excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly.Protect against sunburn. Sunburn affects the body's ability to cool itself, so protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Drink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated will help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature..Treatments:The underlying cause must be removed. Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a cool place.Heat stroke that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures. Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke.In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.When body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures.Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures.
