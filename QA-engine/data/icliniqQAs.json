    "answer": "i read through your query and understood your concern. she can take progesterone tablets (medroxyprogesterone 10mg twice daily) to postpone her period. these tablets may increase the requirement of antidiabetic medicines (tablets/insulin). so she needs to monitor her blood sugar level (at least two/three times during the period she is taking tablets) to make sure that sugar control is fine. contraceptive pills used nowadays are low dose pills and have little/no impact on diabetes. even if sugar levels increase it can be treated by increasing the dose of antidiabetic medicines. so she can use low dose contraceptive pills. just consult your physician once before starting those pills to make sure that the medicines do not interact with each other. during pregnancy - if her sugar control is fine from 3 months before pregnancy during pregnancy and till delivery of baby there will practically be no problem to the mother and baby. if sugar control is not good there may be many problems about which there is no need to worry right now. revert back to a gynaecologist online for further queries --> <link>",

    "answer": "i completely emphasize with you. the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more. honestly most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes. when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina). there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act. but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. regarding your problem pertaining to non-retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. so make an appointment with a general surgeon. for further queries consult a sexologist online --> <link>",

So, I would like to get your opinion in response to some of my questions:\nGiven my young age and this pressure, will it likely lead to glaucoma?\nMy potential life expectancy is still important, is there a risk of blindness?\nI have a 4 years old boy, when should he start being examined for this problem?\nI would like to have more children, however, I wonder about the risk of transmitting a possible glaucoma which slows me yet.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "while some antibiotics do induce hepatic enzymes to decrease the efficacy of contraceptive pills amoxicillin is not one of them and can be safely used without the fear of contraceptive failure. however it is important to stick to the contraceptive schedule. if you have taken crisanta (ethinyl estradiol) regularly without missing any pills then you can rely on it completely. if you have missed a couple of pills or more then it will be prudent to use a backup method like condom. crisanta has to be used regularly as advised. there is no modification in the course or dosage necessary. no backup contraceptive required if you have not missed any pills in this cycle and have been taking crisanta for more than one cycle. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "from the way you described it seems that you have a locked back. so you need a few medicines and physiotherapy. instructions to reduce back pain and stiffness are as follows: avoid lifting heavy weights sitting for a long time and two wheeler rides. avoid arching your back; instead bend your knees to pick up something from the floor. improve your posture while sitting and try to get up from your chair for every 20 minutes. take a quick walk around then continue working and always sit on a chair with back support. do not get up suddenly from a sleeping position. rather turn to the side and then get up. take bed rest if you feel severe pain. do hot fomentations locally over the affected area at least twice a day. i suggest you to apply oxalgin gel (diclofenac) for local application twice a day. i also suggest tablet pregabalin 75 mg one tablet at night for 15 days before food at 7 pm every day and tablet etoricoxib 60 mg one tablet at morning and night for 10 days after food. you can take rabeprazole 20 mg one tablet at night for 10 days before food and shelcal (calcium carbonate and vitamin d3) 500 mg one tablet at morning and night for 30 days before food. take d-shine 60 k one tablet daily for ten days and then once a month for 11 months. take these tablets only if you are not allergic to them. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent. these tablets will also help the heaviness of the head. if back stiffness does not reduce then you will need some blood investigation. do physiotherapy like mckenzie back extension exercises back core strengthening exercises glute strengthening exercises and passive straight leg raising exercises. these exercises can be done initially under a supervision of a physiotherapist or learn to do it at home. only regular exercises can give the result. once the pain gets reduced then do the following activities like swimming yoga and walking which are good for you. jogging running and weight lifting may aggravate back problems. the probable causes:1. locked back. 2. ankylosing spondylitis. regarding follow up:revert back if stiffness persists even after seven days to a orthopaedician and traumatologist online. ---> <link>",

Then the test revealed\u00a0HbA1c of 6.6 and fasting sugar 108. Then my doctor reduced the dose to 500 mg. From then I am taking Kombiglyze XR 500 mg one tablet a day. Last week my HbA1c was\u00a06.6. I have attached my entire blood test report. I am deficient of vitamin D, B12 and iron. I had Tayo 60 k tablet one per week for three weeks. I have pain in heel bone on the side of both feet. I feel sharp pain on the side of heel, especially in the early morning or after sitting for a while. I feel fatigue sometimes. I do not have any other health issues. I am eating well and my sleep is good. Can you recommend diet plan or any changes in medication or vitamin supplement? I am a vegetarian. Thank you.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "i have understood your concern. dislocation is accidental slippage of bone from the actual space and when it happens it will make surrounding muscles ligaments and capsule over stretch and so ultimately pain will be due to all structures. first you need to strengthen the surrounding muscles perfectly with the faith that you will improve. it may take six months or more. do not worry about it and you need to have more patience. in supervision of skilled physiotherapist you need to do all exercise. you can take some pain relieving modalities like ift and swd therapies (interferential therapy and short wave diathermy) by which pain intensity will decrease. but this is not a permanent option. non-vegetarian food will not affect much. i insist to rely on pure vegetarian protein and calcium diet. take bananas and milk as much as possible. avoid junk foods and do proper exercise. for further information consult a fitness expert online --> <link>",

    "answer": "as you are 21 year old the acne is mainly due to hormonal changes. as far as scars are concerned do not peel or squeeze your acne. the scars which are already present can be lightened off. for acne try herbal things at home because the cause is very important. as your hormones will get balanced with age the acne will start reducing. take turmeric and sandalwood powder and add rose water to it. make a paste and apply this paste early in the morning. after 10 minutes wash it off gently with water and wipe your face with a soft cotton towel. for scars i suggest you apply aloe vera gel on them twice a day. this will help in lighting them. use mild herbal face wash and do not use harsh soap for face. avoid going directly in sunlight apply sunscreen before going outside. avoid taking the stress avoid excessive spicy and junk food caffeinated drinks etc. drink plenty of liquids and take fresh fruits and vegetables. however if acne is due to some infection then you need to visit a nearby dermatologist otherwise hormonal related acne problem will settle down with time. for further information consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. remember the following measures to control pimples. do not use hair oil and avoid oily foods chocolates and milk products. do not use any steroid creams. face wash and soaps are not the treatment and they do not help. do not touch the acne and avoid pressing it. regarding treatment of pimple i suggest clindamycin (clintop faceclin or clear gel). this is more of preventive and curative so i tell patients to use it all over face in the morning and use adapalene gel (adapalene or differin) over acne in the night. i also suggest you to take tablet doxy (doxycycline) 100 mg once in a day. consult your doctor discuss with him/her and take the medicine with consent. if you have acne marks avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. wear sunglass cap and cover exposed part of your body all the time use sunscreen thrice in a day such as 10 am 12 pm and 3 pm. it has to be applied all over the face. sunscreen spf (sun protection factor) should be around 50. use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like kojic acid hydroquinone depiwhite cream etc. in the night. ideal treatment is glycolic acid peels. sittings of six to eight peels must be required. post acne scars are three types. box scar ice-pick (pinpoint scars) and rolling scars. pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy. no cream or tablet can help you out in scars. best technique is co2 fractional laser and subscision. it takes five to six sitting but results are better than any other procedure. dermaroller and subscision are also other methods but less effective than the above. fillers do have hiding effect. it fills the pits and gives impression of fullness and it is not permanent. if scars are not much prominent then peels also could be effective. these are technique you can go through. all procedures take four to five sitting and five to six months for better results. for further information consult a dermatologist online --> <link>",

But, it was only on that day. Normally, I used to bleed heavily for almost five days.\u00a0I thought it was an implantation bleeding, so I took a\u00a0home pregnancy test after seven days and the result was negative. My breasts are swollen. I am getting tired even if I walk a little. I am getting headache almost every day. I am wondering whether I am pregnant. My doctor said no blood test required as it showed negative. But, I somehow feel that I am pregnant. What to do?\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: 1) tartar or plaque deposits (soft yellowish deposits) on the teeth. 2) calculus deposits (calcified hard deposits) on the teeth. 3) fluorosis - internal discoloration of the teeth due to altered fluorine content in the drinking water. you have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. from your history it is very clear that the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. this gets partially removed with brushing. calculi are hard deposits either yellowish greenish or sometimes blackish in color. they are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. during childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. \"tooth worms\" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. these bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. the lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. at this age of yours these deposits may be due to: 1) improper brushing technique. 2) brushing only once a day. 3) malalignment of your teeth. 4) crowding of your teeth (due to inadequate spacing in between the teeth). 5) if you are having any prosthetic teeth (crown bridge removable appliances). 6) if you are undergoing orthodontic treatment (wire braces). dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. but it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. hence scaling is not a wastage of money it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. so a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: 1) brush with toothpaste and brush twice daily. the head of the toothbrush should be angulated in such a way that it reaches all the teeth and all the interior and hidden parts of the teeth. 2) use an antibacterial mouthwash only for the time period for which the dentist has prescribed. because long term use of mouthwash itself will cause staining of teeth. 3) rinse your mouth thoroughly soon after every meal. 4) in case you are wearing wire braces or prosthesis use the specific tooth brushes (orthodontic toothbrushes) to clean the teeth thoroughly well. 5) use interdental toothbrushes to clean the minute spaces in between the teeth. 6) visit a dentist once in every 6 months and get a scaling done if necessary. as your doctor has told regular use of colgate toothpaste is sufficient. sensodyne toothpaste is not needed for you since it is used for hypersensitive teeth. glodent toothpaste helps in stain removal and it can be used if extrinsic stains are present on the teeth. it does cause teeth whitening. regular use of mouthwash is not essential. you can use hexidine mouthwash for about two weeks and then stop it. bleaching is the procedure used to remove internal or intrinsic staining of the teeth which is not required for you. and finally pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. teeth which are slightly yellow without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. hope this answer helps you. take care. consult a dentist online for further follow up --> <link>",

    "question": "i am doing better with my anti-anxiety drug. do i need counseling?",
    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHello doctor, I am 45 years old and working as a senior level finance professional in a multi-partner practice owned by all of us. After going through the high levels of anxiety for several years, I consulted a psychologist who is my friend. After few months of showing little improvement, he put me on Escitalopram 10 mg. For about 2 years I took this medicine and was generally fine. When my friend moved out of the country, I shifted to a new doctor and he is a more senior person. He changed the drug to Paroxetine 25 mg which I have been on for the last nine months. I would probably say I am doing better now than before. The issue is regarding further counseling. While my friend did not feel that there is a need to continue counseling once he put me on the medicine. But, the new one seems to feel that I should resume counseling. Based on his advise, I went back to the counselor I originally saw, but somehow she seems to feel that I do not need any structured counseling.\nI am generally a religious person and try to follow certain regular spiritual practices like visiting a temple almost every day, reading at least a little from any scripture and do some chanting. At the same time, I still have the little odd feelings of discomfort too at times, though it does not trouble me so much like earlier. Specific cause of worry now is mostly the side effect of the long-term medication I take for anxiety, BP (Telmesartan) and for GERD (Esomeprazole).\u00a0The primary concern now is that on most days I have a general feeling of boredom as though there is not anything much to do. Generally, I try to avoid associating with any new demanding assignments because I do not feel comfortable about doing things unless I am fully sure about the work. On the other side, it is also my dream to be a successful writer of fiction novels. I have finished one book, but that has not found any worthy publisher so far, which is disappointing. So, even though I have been working on my second book, I  do not have too much confidence that my writing will reach anywhere.\nI am not a social type person and like to spend time at home. I will also confess that by nature I am known as a negative thinker, both at work and in the house. But my relationship with people are generally very cordial, because I try to lighten issues and also try my best to avoid any sort of conflict. All this leaves me with a general sense of dissatisfaction, although I am very clear that I do not want to stick my neck any further out either. Though at times, I fantasize about career and location change. I do not dare to think anything seriously, because I am sure that I will not get such a comfortable position again.\u00a0But, to conclude the issue which is confusing me right now is, do I need counseling again? I am far from clear, what can I hope to achieve from therapy which I cannot get from my religious and spiritual practices? I note that online therapy is also an option on this site. Is that as effective as direct counseling?\t\t\t\t",

Also, I\u00a0have got mild acne on the back and scars as well. Please provide a solution for this and suggest me the course of action of the cosmetic treatment and fillers.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "if you have taken the urine pregnancy test after seven days of missed periods then the results are usually conclusive. you may repeat the test after 48 hours and if it is still negative then you are not pregnant. the delay can possibly be due to stress induced hormonal imbalance especially during this cycle due to stressors which can easily delay your menses. if your menses do not arrive naturally in next one week then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone. a single delayed period is not an indication for infertility workup. repeat the tests and consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "rosacea is a skin disorder that affects people above 30 years. other than acne like lesions people with rosacea have redness of face and dry skin associated with burning sensation. they also have redness and irritation in the eyes. the redness of the face is aggravated by triggering factors such as weather changes stress alcohol consumption exercise and spicy food. yours clinical condition is not rosacea since your history is contradicting with the above said information. you seem to have acne. the cysts are a part of acne. acne varies in severity from individual to individual. some may have mild acne which may come off and on. others may have almost incessant eruption of acne which may leave behind post acne hyperpigmentation and acne scars. for acne you need to be constantly taking care care of your skin until the tendency for new acne formation dies down. topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (clindamycin gel or nadifloxacin gel) benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. topical retinoids are comedolytic thereby preventing new acne. for inflammatory acne (papules and pustules) i advise to start with one of the oral antibiotics either azithromycin doxycycline or minocycline. cystic acne is an indication for starting oral retinoids. they are the most effective drugs for acne and are usually first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or moderately severe acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications or acne significantly affecting the quality of life of patients regardless of severity. you could also take a few peeling sessions like salicylic acid peels from a dermatologist. salicylic acid peels are specific for acne. acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance of improvement. topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance of improvement because they are comedolytic as well as anti-inflammatory thereby preventing the formation of new acne. for further follow up consult a dermatologist online --> <link>",

I have no known heart conditions except for many PVCs and PACs. I was recently diagnosed and picked up on a 48-hour Holter with atrial flutter. My doctor did not say that I had aFib. Doctor wants me to have a chemical stress test for what I have been experiencing now for about a year. Once in every four to seven days, tachycardia wakes me up and it only happens at night time and never during the daytime. In the middle of the night when I am sleeping I feel very hot. And, when this is happening my heart rate shoots up from 120 to 170 BPM and will last anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes and slowly starts to come down. Yes, I do feel anxious when this is happening and I have had panic attacks. Before, they do not feel like panic attacks, but it is still uncomfortable and worrisome. This is driving me crazy. There is no shortness of breath or dizziness. My TSH and T3 are normal.\nI went to the gynecologist and had a full workup for hormones and all tests were normal. My bloodwork was normal with my cardiologist. My HbA1C was normal. I lost my son before 1.5 years. I cried every day for one full year and I am still heartbroken. Now, I do not want to use that as my reason for tachycardia, because this wakes me up out of a dead sleep. I feel very hot and my skin is red when this is happening. I have to get up and walk around because\u00a0it is bothersome. Any of your answers and ideas would be very helpful. My gynecologist does not think that has anything to do with my hormones. I do not know if adrenalin rises in the middle of the night with postmenopausal women. And, my cardiologist has no idea of what this could be.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "implantable defibrillators are implanted to terminate an episode of atrial arrhythmia. afib (atrial fibrillation) is also a type of atrial arrhythmia. the icd not only provides treatment for atrial arrhythmias but also provides treatment for ventricular arrhythmias as well as rate-responsive dual chamber pacing for the treatment of bradycardia. the pacing attempts to gain control over the arrhythmia by interrupting the pathway of the atrial arrhythmia and uses low energy pacing which is usually goes unnoticed by the patient. in cases when atp (antitachycardia pacing) is successful the patient may not even be aware that they have had an arrhythmia until their device follow-up. so the answer for your question is icd cannot cause atrial fibrillation until and unless it is implanted incorrectly; rather it will terminate an episode of atrial fibrillation automatically. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>",

He prescribed me some medicines first, and it gave me huge relief. I got rid of all the acne within 10 days. Three months passed and as the winter season came nearer, they again started appearing all over my face and then gone after some time. I visited dermatologist again who suggested me to take regular peels. I started taking sittings of peeling and after one or two peeling my face started improving and got clear in\u00a0some time. Peeling worked like magic. It was superficial face peel, but do not know about the acid content and the type of acid he used to apply. He used to say that he was giving me mild peel. I stopped taking peeling as I had to leave my place and shift to the different location due to the job change. It was good for a\u00a0couple of months until the\u00a0temperature change. I started getting rosacea symptoms again though at this time rate of acne and bumps was low, still, it bothered a lot. Currently, I am on medication which my old dermatologist\u00a0suggested. It is Papulex face wash for summer, non-drying cleanser for winter,\u00a0Fisioativ cream for the night to moisturize the skin and Fix Derma UV protection, which I still apply daily thrice a day.

It looks like I am crying and I will either cough until I throw up mucus or fluid or vomit if I have just eaten, and then I can breathe again. It happens on the bus, at work, and sometimes at night.

I hugged a friend at the dance, and I went from fine to immediate coughing in about 5 to 10 seconds. I will have a few weeks of this, and then it will clear up on its own. Last week, this happened about 10 times, and itchy throat spells where I worked on breathing through it. I am always sucking on throat lozenges during these weeks.My total IgE level taken during one of these symptoms filled weeks was 736 ug/L, where\u00a0reference range is less than 416 ug/L for adults.

    "answer": "you have asked an interesting question. peanut allergy is one of the most severe food allergies. it can cause itchiness urticaria swelling eczema sneezing asthma abdominal pain drop in blood pressure and cardiac arrest. it may even result in anaphylactic death if not controlled in the right time. the routes of exposure of the allergen are mostly the accidental ingestion of peanuts or pb by the concerned person (who is hypersensitive to peanuts). air-borne particles in a farm or factory or crushing environment may cause respiratory symptoms in allergic individuals. however the odor of peanut butter or its mere proximity have not produced any allergic symptoms in various studies conducted. hence answering your questions. it is safe to carry peanut butter in plane. if you are carrying it as part of hand baggage (cabin baggage) make sure it is packed properly in a colored container. this is just to prevent any psychogenic allergic symptoms in those susceptible individuals who may see the butter and develop allergy (however such psychogenic reactions are very rare but still documented in studies). since the pb as such is not an allergen by sight/proximity/odor a susceptible person need not take extra precautions to avoid allergy when someone else is carrying pb. however since psychogenic reactions can occur it may be advised that such a susceptible person may change his seat to another seat away from person who is carrying peanut butter. for further information consult an allergic specialist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up --> <link>",

    "answer": "your doctor is right in saying that your son has allergic conjunctivitis. eye allergies called allergic conjunctivitis are a common condition that occurs when the eyes react to something that irritates them called an allergen. the most common allergens are dust and pollens. the eyes produce a substance called histamine to fight off the allergen. as a result the eyelids and conjunctiva (the thin filmy membrane that covers the inside of your eyelids) become red swollen and itchy with tearing and burning. the key to treating eye allergies are avoid or limit contact with the substance causing the problem. avoid rubbing eyes instead do cold compresses. use antiallergic eye drop like olopatadine along with lubricating eye drop. we prescribe mild steroid in pulse dose in case allergy is severe. in longstanding allergy we also prescribe tacrolimus (talimus ointment) with very good results. some doctors also prescribe cyclosporine instead of tacrolimus and that is also effective in longstanding cases. this will help you and i am very sorry to say that there is no medicine to cure allergy. only way is to stay away from all those things that you are allergic to. also this allergy will trouble him every year and usually after puberty it decreases. for further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "i totally understand your concern regarding cure of allergies. unfortunately allergy of the nose cannot be totally cured but definitely can be prevented. i would recommend the following:1. get an allergy skin test done; so as to identify the allergen. avoiding the allergen is half the solution to the problem. the allergen source could be dust sources like carpets/bedding/mattresses. avoid indoor plants/pollens. pet fur/hair is also a common cause. 2. get a ct scan of your sinuses. you could be having polyps in your sinuses; which may be contributing to your nose block. if so; your ent doctor may advise you to undergo a surgery to open up your sinuses; to enable you to breathe better. 3. taking a steroid spray regularly will give relief of your symptoms. you do need to take it for 2-3 months during the season. taking an antihistamine like allegra with steroid sprays is beneficial in moderate allergic rhinitis. 4. the latest treatment is immunotherapy; offered in some allergy centres. you can contact your local specialist for the same. it is a permanent cure; but it takes a long time for the immunity to develop. hope the above helps. if you do have a scan do share it with me and i can guide you further. keep your allergies under control; as a neglected sneeze can lead to aggravation of your wheeze. consult an ent otolaryngologist online for further help --> <link>",

    "answer": "it sounds like your friend is bothered by the persistent tingling and numbness in his left foot. i understand these sensations can be quite irritating especially if your work involves standing for long periods. did he have these tingling sensations in the same areas before the surgery? if so have these worsened after the surgery or remained the same? i assume his symptoms before the surgery were also on the left side and his hemilaminectomy was also performed on the left side. it will be nice if i could see the preoperative mri images to see what the hemilaminectomy was done for. often if the surgery involves removal of a large herniated disc or the space available for the nerve is very less (stenosis) then the nerve may get bruised during surgery due to retraction. this means that in order to decompress the nerve the surgeon has to retract the nerve to go around the nerve and remove the compressing elements. if the compression is severe the nerve gets bruised easily and there may be persistent numbness and tingling in the areas of the leg and foot that are geographically supplied by that nerve. since the surgeon has advised him to wait it out i assume this is likely the case. swelling of the foot is common if the nerve supplying that area is not fully functional. the weak muscles in the leg and foot are not able to push the blood back up towards the heart and gravity causes this dependent area to swell up. this is often seen at the end of the day and gets better at night when he sleeps. it is difficult to predict how long the tingling will last. it could be a few months. the fact that there is tingling and not pure numbness is actually encouraging although it is more irritating to the patient. if it were a complete nerve injury then only numbness would be experienced. the presence of tingling means that the nerve is just irritated inflamed and swollen due to the bruising. if the tingling is very bothersome he may try some neuralgic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) may also help in this situation. there is a very rare possibility of other complications like recurrent disc herniation other post-surgical changes irritating the nerve etc. these are difficult to diagnose and usually need a new mri with contrast. however it is advisable to delay such investigation for at least for two to three months after surgery since the mri images at this stage will be obscured by the post surgical changes. if the symptoms of tingling and numbness are progressively worsening and if he develops back pain a new mri may be needed irrespective of the time since surgery to rule out infection or instability. the probable causes:surgical retraction of nerve that may have caused it to bruise. investigations to be done:none if symptoms are not progressively worsening. differential diagnosis:recurrent disc herniation. treatment plan:gabapentin or pregabalin and nsaids. regarding follow up:for further doubts consult a spine surgeon online. ---> <link>",

    "answer": "bad smell during breathing could be due to various reasons. let us see those one by one. malignancy: an intranasal (inside the nose) or intraoral (inside the mouth) malignancy can produce foul smell that can be perceived as faeces smell by the nose. malignancy can be painless and without any symptoms. malignancies of paranasal air sinuses also produce foul odor. dental infection: a tooth decay can produce bad smell. dental infection usually produces significant pain. food particles get collected inside the decayed tooth and hence cause the bad smell. sinusitis: chronic sinusitis can cause constant post nasal drip and purulent discharge (pus discharge). this results in foul odor. maxillary sinusitis commonly produces foul odor. sinusitis will have other symptoms like headache facial pain nasal blockage post nasal drip etc. foreign body inside nose: a foreign body which has got stuck inside nose without being removed for many days will produce purulent discharge and smell. the discharge will be from one side of the nose. it is common among kids. foreign body produces nasal block. atrophic rhinitis: it is a disease where the normal space inside the nose gets increased due to destruction of the anatomy. also the condition causes merciless anosmia (loss of sensation of smell). the sufferer cannot perceive any smell but the people around him can get the extreme foul odor emanating from the patients nose. atrophic rhinitis also presents with crusting inside nose and nose block. maggots in nose: maggots are larval stage of fly (chrysomia). maggots usually occur in association with atrophic rhinitis. fly lays its eggs inside nose leading to maggots inside nose. they are attracted to the foul odor and they themselves aggravate the odor. tonsillitis: pus accumulated over the tonsil can cause bad smell. tonsillar enlargement with infection and consequent foul breath is common in many children. other symptoms of tonsillitis include fever throat pain enlarged lymph nodes of neck difficulty and pain while swallowing. nasal diphtheria can produce foul odor. diphtheria produces a membrane over the affected mucosa. rhinitis caseosa: it is a destructive disease producing foul odor. it was thought to be a fungal disease exact etiology is still not clear. tuberculosis: tb of nasal mucosa produces granulomatous inflammation and caseating necrosis consequent death of tissues and foul smell. hope i have cleared your query. further evaluation and clinical examination is required. regarding follow up:for further follow up consult an ent otolaryngologist online. ---> <link>",

    "answer": "tachycardia which she had was mostly probably psvt (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or other svt (supraventricular tachycardia) which are usually episodic in nature. so the reading which you had of 123 was probably not due to her old heart problem psvt but it was sinus tachycardia may be because of activities or stress dehydration pain etc. and baseline heart rate at the time was also probably in the same range. heart rate is the highly variable parameter. heart rate normally changes with many things like anxiety activities fever dehydration and many other and this is very well normal. the heart rate of 120 to 140 could normally be achieved. if one has an episode of psvt then he would be symptomatic like severe palpitations shortness of breath chest pain and heart rate is usually above 150. so the heart rate of 95 is normal and no need to worry. the heart rate of 123 was not probably psvt or svt but just a sinus tachycardia. if it was then these are episodic tachycardia and returns to baseline on their own. if she has repeat episodes then she should cough hard to abort the episode and may be neck massage if taught by a doctor after neck examination. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "actually there are many causes of decreased vision and itching for which you need to rub your eyes. please answer a few questions. since how long you are using glasses? when you had your last refraction? do you have any eye allergy itching watering or redness that get worse in specific season? is this problem persist all day or it is more in the morning or evening? have you got an eye examination or using any drops currently? so from the complaints you described there may be just a change in refraction. if your refraction (glass number) is changing again and again then you might need to get a full eye examination and a few investigations. in cases with repeated change in refraction quickly there are chances of a condition called keratoconus in which shape of the cornea becomes conical and gets thin. at your age the cause of excessive rubbing may be allergic conjunctivitis called vernal keratoconjunctivitis (conjunctivitis due to some seasonal allergy). keratoconus is more common in people who have vernal keratoconjunctivitis. other causes may some congenital corneal dystrophy in which superficial corneal layers are peeled off with mild rubbing and cause blurred vision. so i would advise you to get a complete eye examination and your eye doctor can order some investigations like corneal topography if needed. then further management will depend on the eye examination. revert back with the answers to the above questions to an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "welcome to icliniq. com. the best oral hygiene maintenance method is to brush your teeth with a soft or medium toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. the electronic toothbrush does not offer any real additional benefit to normal individuals. it is the movements of the toothbrush made by our hands that bring about thorough cleaning. most of the toothpastes available in the market are good as long as they contain up to 1000 ppm fluoride. brushing three times is good. the main goal is to clean the food deposits from all areas. rinsing the mouth after meals is good yet a simple method to keep the mouth clean. using a mouthwash causes no real problem in relation to upsetting the microflora or healthy bacteria. you can continue to use it once a day. professional cleaning is recommended every 6 to 12 months depending on your plaque and calculus forming tendency. due to plaque deposition over a long period there is temporary decalcification that might occur on the tooth surface. thus on professional cleaning when it is removed there will a slight increased sensitivity. however it does not remove the enamel layer at a significant level. so once we continue to use the fluoride toothpaste with a toothbrush along with natural fluoride in water the tooth surface gets remineralized. and then the sensitivity disappears. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "you can bleed more sometimes due to irregular menses because of hormonal (chemical) levels of your body and its effect. but you can bleed also due to cervical erosions and infection there. i personally never recommend tampons. because your menstrual blood contains some bacteria and pathogens which can infect. and when you use tampons due to the collected blood it gives a media to growth of that bacteria. the body can resist infection up to a limit and as the limit crosses you get signs and symptoms of infection for which you may have to take treatment. now in your case foul-smelling discharge and discoloration of the discharge are the signs of infection. now i have to see actually where the infection is. so best consult your nearby gynecologist. let him see where the infection is and what type of discharge actually is. and if required then send the discharge for examination. by this we will know the type of infection and can give treatment accordingly. most probably you are having history which seems to be likely bacterial vaginosis. it is a mixed infection. you will need to take the antibiotic course for 10 to 15 days and follow some precautions to avoid recurrence. now as far as antibiotics are concerned i have to see the first type and nature of discharge and smell. so better get consulted nearby for that. kindly keep up the following precautions: do not use tampons. use pads and change more frequently during menses. keep the area around the vagina as dry as possible especially during menses. change underwear more frequently if required. use cotton underwear if possible. drink more water as your urine becomes clear. do clean vaginal area and immediately after urination and after every time you do sex. these will help to avoid recurrence. and firstly complete the drug course to completely eradicate the infection. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

I did not think much of it and just used tampons until I was sure it was done. I had sex with my boyfriend and discovered that I was still very much bleeding. The strangest thing is the odor graduated from that bloody smell to a foul odor and the color changed on my tampon. It ranges from dark brown to yellowish to green with dabs of bright red. It is also only drawn into two particular places on the tampon, the right and just a small spot in the left center.\u00a0The tampon is also never drenched in blood; it is a light flow just in those two areas.

    "answer": "you are missing the most important thing that is the pregnancy test is an error which means it is not positive. of course if iud (intrauterine device) is displaced from the normal position there is a chance of pregnancy and also of tubal ectopic pregnancy. but it is not that all cases have a tubal pregnancy. only after around 14 to 20 days of missed periods you can see the baby's heartbeat on the scan. there is no matter how good the scan is. the thing which you saw could be your heartbeat and it can be mistaken. the red and blue color is doppler scan which just shows the flow of blood to and fro. the most confirmatory test would be serum beta hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) and this can diagnose a pregnancy no matter how small it is. only when the value goes above 1500 iu/ml the baby's sac can be seen on the scan not before. so you can decide when to scan. the discharge can be the fluid from uterus cavity or cervical canal when the iud came out. fallopian tube swelling on the scan is not very conclusive. for further information consult an obstetrician and obstetrician online --> <link>",

    "answer": "from going through the information you have provided it is clear that currently you are on treatment for suspected gerd - gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux disease). you have been having intermittent problems over five years. acid reflux can cause breathlessness and waking up from sleep at night. some might feel and describe heartburns but others may not actually feel the burning sensation. the symptoms can be worsened by stress anxiety and panic attacks. my recommendations are an endoscopy procedure called gastroscopy will help to check for any weakness in the valve at the lower end of the food pipe (gullet or esophagus) and to directly visualize any evidence of inflammation there that is reflux esophagitis. following the above test you may require a 24 hour ph monitoring study and a manometry test to confirm that acid is refluxing back whenever you have symptoms and that there is no problem with motility of the gullet. i agree with you that i would not continue on perinorm cd (metoclopramide). i tend to give it only for nausea or vomiting. nexpro (esomeprazole) 40 mg is best taken once daily in empty stomach in the morning. if despite this symptoms persist it can be taken twice daily before food that is before breakfast and the other before dinner at night. you can take topcid (famotidine) 40 mg at bedtime to prevent symptoms at night. some people with gerd may find that eliminating certain food helps to improve their symptoms. for example avoiding spicy foods raw onion garlic black pepper citrus products and juices of orange grapefruit or cranberry tomato products chocolate or brownies caffeine sodas coffee tea etc. peppermint fatty or greasy foods. eat smaller and frequent meals. try to eat more slowly try to spend at least 30 minutes per meal and avoid eating on the run. avoid large high fat meals. avoid late evening snacks or eating before bed. avoid lying flat after eating; try sitting up for at least two hours after finishing a meal and sleep on your left side. try light walking for 15 to 30 minutes following a meal. try chewing non-mint type chewing gum for 30 minutes following a meal. raise the head of the bed 6 to 8 inches to prevent reflux when sleeping. extra pillows may only elevate your head. try putting pillows under the mattress near the head of the bed or use a special wedge. avoid tight fitting clothes around the abdomen. i wish you a speedy recovery. investigations to be done:1. gastroscopy. 2. 24 hour esophageal ph monitoring and esophageal manometry. probable diagnosis:1. gerd. 2. functional dyspepsia. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. ---> <link>",

    "answer": "firstly as you had bleeding after eight days post unwanted 72 intake it ensures that you are not pregnant. your fresh menstrual date would now be the date of the bleeding started after the ecp (emergency contraceptive pill). there is a likelihood that next menses may be delayed by a week to 10 days which is a known side effect of unwanted 72. neatly it is not an ectopic pregnancy. but the chance of endometriosis rises if intercourse is undertaken during menstrual bleed which can later lead to ectopic if endometriosis gets severe. if still you wish to conclusively rule out pregnancy then you may get a serum beta hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) test done. if the hcg levels are less than 3 miu/ml then you are surely not pregnant. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

I do exercise with weights regularly.\u00a0I have noticed that I have reduced feeling in the skin on my shaft. I cannot feel normal touch, but I can feel the pain if I pinch it with my nails. To best describe it; it feels like my penis is not there when the head was covered by foreskin. I just noticed it two weeks ago. Is this due to nerve impingement? I do not have any back pain or radiating pain down the legs. There is no trouble or pain with defecation or urinating. There is no tingling or pins and needles on the shaft. Rarely, I feel some burning or numbness feeling. I do not notice any discoloration or anatomical abnormalities. Is this a sign of diabetes? But, there are no symptoms such as\u00a0polydipsia, polyuria, etc. I do not remember any\u00a0trauma to the penis.\u00a0I do not ride bicycles at all. I have been to a urologist and done an ultrasound of the penis and testicles along with a Doppler. But, there is no finding to be worried.My libido is very low. I get erections during the night or if I really concentrate on erotic thoughts. I have not tested testosterone levels, but I suspect them to be normal. I do not really mind the reduced feeling in the shaft. But, it would be nice to get it back. I am worried by thinking that it may spread or this is a start of a more serious disease.\u00a0What is your opinion?\u00a0Thanks in advance.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "the heavy bleeding may be due to the fibroid and menopausal symptoms. hence we need to treat fibroid and hormonal imbalance. for your condition i suggest you try taking the following medicines. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. tablet aloes compound two tablets thrice a day. capsule rasagandhi mezhugu one tablet twice a day. tablet chitramoola kuligai one tablet twice a day. you need to continue these drugs for three months. within one week the bleeding will stop. then gradually the uterine fibroid will be reduced in size. after few more months your uterus will become normal. if you can collect or buy the bark of jambul tree crush 50 gm of the bark with 300 ml of water. boil in mild flame and reduce it to 50 ml. then drink it. this should be consumed in the morning and evening on an empty stomach. this has the potential to stop the excess bleeding. use banana flower in cooking. it is also good to control uterine bleeding. another option is using hormones given by a gynecologist but that should be your last option. this drug gives only symptomatic relief it does not reduce the fibroid uterus size. for more information consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "at the age of 24 year it is unlikely that you have ulcer in the stomach. it could be gerd (gastroesophageal reflux disease) that is causing all these symptoms but after long time it may cause ulcer. if you are not responding to ppis (proton-pump inhibitors) then it could be h. pylori infection that is causing the problem. the investigations you have mentioned are not having much abnormalities except mild anaemia. the management of gerd symptoms include medicines as well as dietary modifications and exercise with position maneuvers. usually we do not do investigations but if it is not responding to medicines then it is needed. advice:tablet omeprazole 20mg twice a day half an hour before food intake. syrup gelusil 5ml along with food (you can take every time) continue it till you have pain and heartburn. tablet amoxicillin 1000mg twice a day for 15 days. tablet clarithromycin 500mg twice a day for 15 days. avoid oily and spicy meal coffee and tea. do exercise daily (walking or jogging). take small and frequent meals. avoid liqiuds prefer solid and semisolid food especially before sleep. sleep in left lateral position with elevation of head end. you have anaemia so please take iron and folic acid (100mg iron combination) once daily. these disorders have great relation to behaviour and mood changes so please alleviate any tension. get thyroid function test (tft) and fasting glucose level done. do not quit your job instead work with more energy and enthusiasm. i have provided the treatment plan with medicines and other measures for 15 days. revert back to a medical gastroenterologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "you have mentioned numbness in the inner part of the left foot as your main symptom. most commonly numbness is a manifestation of a nerve involvement it can be compression of the nerve at an anatomical site like in back or anywhere along the course of the nerve or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease like diabetes or any condition that leads to what we call as neuropathy. now your trigger has been the yoga courses which you do on a regular basis every year but you have done may be for a prolonged period this year. being an orthopaedic surgeon i may not be able to guide you anything regarding yoga and its usefulness but it is logical to stop all these postures till your condition settles and improves. my guess is that there has been some prolonged compression during your classes or there could be an entrapment somewhere along the course of your nerve. i need to know from you: whether you have any back pain? is there any radiating pain from the spine region all along the course of your limb? apart from numbness are there any other symptoms of neurological involvement like weakness paresthesias burning sensations etc. also present? if the answers to above questions are no my suggestion to you will be to wait for a few days and start with medications for neuropathic symptoms like pregabalin or gabapentin along with vitamin b 12 supplementation and it is a good possibility that your symptoms may subside over next 4-6 weeks because there might be nerve neuropraxia (mid nerve injury). in case your symptoms do not improve or if they increase then i suggest you to get few blood tests done and nerve conduction studies to look for any compressive pathology. get back to an orthopaedician and traumatologist online for further queries --> <link>",

A typical vipassana requires sitting for 13-14 hours with small breaks at regular intervals. I thought I will get better once I start doing activity after coming back home (though I used to walk for 15-20 minutes daily during the course also). I never had such problem in the past courses. There was no improvement in the condition even after 15 days after coming back. I have done alternate hot and cold water treatment but did not see any improvement.

I was not able to get an appointment until yesterday.  Two days after my ER visit, I began having severe chills and running fever as high as 101.5.  The urologist did a UA yesterday, and said I did not have an infection. And also he did a KUB, which showed my stone had not moved at all.  He scheduled me for a lithotripsy next Tuesday.  I continue to have severe chills and fever.  I called his office today and he says I probably have flu.  Is it possible that I have an infection in my right kidney? Because the stone is blocking the ureter. But, urine I am passing is clear and uninfected. Please help.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "if pregnancy is the concern then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hcg test done. this is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. if the levels of hcg are more than 1 or raised then pregnancy is confirmed. if the level is less than 1 then pregnancy is completely ruled out. if the test is positive then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). if the usg shows extrauterine pregnancy then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic. if the pregnancy is intrauterine then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. if the test is negative then the possible cause remains uti (urinary tract infection) or a possible pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) or endometriosis. also stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding inspite of being on continuous progesterone pills. this can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy. for further follow up consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

Mostly the stones would go away on their own without causing any pain. But\u00a0in the last seven to eight months, I had been suffering from recurrent UTIs and mild pain in the kidney. Around four months back, I got an ultrasound done and found a 10 mm stone in the middle pole and 6 mm stone in the lower pole. At that point, I started on ayurvedic medicine\u00a0(Calcury). I got an ultrasound done a month later and found the stone size remains the same. But there was no pain or infection of any sort at that time.\u00a0\nLast month (I was still asymptomatic) I got a KUB done. It showed only one stone, it did not look like a staghorn stone. Few days later, I got another ultrasound at a different place and according to that doctor my stone was 17 mm (in the middle pole) and 8 mm (in the lower pole).\u00a0In the last 15 days, I passed two tiny stones of 3-4 mm which were very soft and pebble shaped. This made me realize that I may possibly have struvite stones. However, for the last one week I am getting immense pain after workout.\u00a0My creatinine was 0.9 last month.\nI would like to ask you the following questions:- What should be my course of action after this? What is causing this sudden pain? How can I find out what kind of stones do I have? Will a shockwave lithotripsy be possible in my case? How accurate is the number 17 mm and 8 mm?\t\t\t\t",

That time, I came to know that my\u00a0blood pressure had risen to 145/85 mmHg.\u00a0Since then, my life has never remained the same. My parents\u00a0are not hypertensive. I was having chest pain and sleeping problems from then. I was given Nifedipine for blood pressure and Lexotan for sleep. After taking these two drugs for two days my condition got worsened. I started having anxiety. I reported back to my doctor. In fact, I personally stopped using those drugs.\nMy BP dropped to a\u00a0range of 125-130/87-80 mmHg. Since I was not comfortable with the blood pressure, I bought a blood pressure monitor to check at home. I am a food technologist. So, I started working on the food I eat.

    "answer": "the symptoms you have mentioned here are indicating towards a migraine headache. however no diagnostic test can surely rule out a migraine. its diagnosis is mainly based on the symptoms. in a migraine there is no definite pain and pain occurs at any time. some people say that a migraine usually occurs on one side of the head and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting but this is not true in all cases. the pain can be all over the head and other symptoms might be present or absent. i suggest you try doing the following. wear sunglasses cover your head with a scarf and use an umbrella whenever you go out in the sun. before going outside always drink one glass of water it will keep you hydrated and will help you. you can take sandalwood oil and massage your scalp a night before washing your hair. avoid excessive intake of tea coffee and caffeinated drinks. some foods also increase the problem of headaches so avoid those. avoid using perfumes deodorant sprays etc. as strong smell may exaggerate the problem. avoid stress anxiety and loud noises. follow a particular sleep pattern i mean try to sleep daily around the same time. if possible try to avoid mobile television laptop etc. an hour before sleep as these emit blue light which hinders normal sleep pattern and also promotes headaches. pranayam is helpful in headaches. so if you can spare 5 to 10 minutes then practice it daily. in medications i suggest you try taking the following. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. pathyadi kwath 15 to 20 ml with an equal amount of water twice a day for six weeks. godanti bhasma 250 mg with water twice a day for four to six weeks. it is an ayurvedic painkiller. shir shuladi vajra ras two tablets twice a day with water for four to six weeks. this ayurvedic medicine is also a painkiller and is used in headaches of various etiology. if you find it tedious to take multiple medicines then you can take only one of these two painkillers or can take two of them for one month. kamdudha ras 250 mg twice a day with water for four to six weeks. it will help in cooling you down internally. take anu taila and put one drop of this oil in each nostril once a day for one month. take powder of sandalwood camphor and jatamansi and. mix all in equal amount and add water or rose water and apply this paste on the forehead while you have a headache. take one teaspoon of coriander powder and add it in one cup of water and keep it for a night. drink it early in the morning on an empty stomach. if you are taking allopathic medicine then take above medicine along with that after consulting your physician. however for a migraine there is no curative treatment. it can only be avoided with the help of medicines and lifestyle changes and sometimes the headache may not disturb you for so long and sometimes may trouble you often so follow a healthy way of life. also stop these medicines during your periods. you can start them after the period gets over. i hope you are satisfied with my answer. for further queries consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "i can understand your anxiety which is quite obvious in this situation. however transfer of the hiv virus through oral sex is low. but it depends on any cuts abrasion on your penis and any ulcer in her mouth. if this is possible then get a blood sample of her because that can be tested for hiv (human immunodeficiency virus). 14 days is a short period for acute hiv infection manifestation but still it is not a guarantee. if cost is not an issue then you can do hiv viral load which can detect viral rna within 10 days of infection. on personal ground i do not think that your symptoms are hiv related. these look more stress related. i will add that hiv is not the only infection you should be worried as you can get other std (sexually transmitted diseases) like hpv (human papilloma virus) syphilis and gonorrhea. as i said above you can do a hiv viral load test which can detect viral rna within 10 days of infection. also next time in addition to being careful i will say that you should present early because the drug useful for prevention is most active in the first 72 hours of exposure. for further information consult a general medicine physician online --> <link>",
    "question": "is headache a symptom of hiv?",
    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi doctor,\nBefore 14 days, I had an encounter with a female escort. We had unprotected oral sex and protected vaginal sex. I am worried about the possibility of HIV as I am experiencing headaches. From day 4 or 5 post exposure, I have had a general malaise feeling in my head, feeling spaced out and slightly dizzy. I have also been having headaches. The headaches come and go and vary in strength. They are always located as a pain between my eyebrows in the procerus muscle. When I massage that part of my head, it goes away for a few seconds and again, last for a couple of hours or so. Most recently, one eye was twitching and was slightly puffy. The headache almost feels like the procerus muscle itself is tight and causing the pain. I have read that the procerus muscle headache is common in sinus infections, but I feel that my sinuses are all fine. I do not have a cold of any sort.\u00a0I have no other typical HIV symptoms, so I am wondering could these types of headache occur through stress or anxiety? I have a fair bit of that just now.\t\t\t\t",

    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi doctor,\nBefore a week, I began having twitches and tingling in both legs from the knee down. For some time now, probably 6 months or more, I also began feeling that my legs were heavy and just general weakness all over, not really muscle weakness. I am also a gastric bypass patient and have a history of low B12, iron saturation and low vitamin D. To complicate matters even more, I went to an orthopedic spine specialist about a month ago, due to the stiffness in my neck. I was unable to turn side to side and this has been going on for several years, like 5 or more. Also, I have a sharp pain between my shoulder blades. My cervical MRI shows moderate facet joint arthritis, small central spur on C5-C6 and some compression of the spinal cord. Even more complicated is that the MRI showed thyroid nodules and the ultrasound reported as typical of a multinodular goiter. My TSH was 4.18.\nI visited my family doctor and he said that the twitches were probably from low vitamin B12. He gave me an injection yesterday and took blood to measure B12 and vitamin D. My vitamin B12 is more than 2000 and vitamin D is 9. I am going insane thinking that I have some horrible neurological disorder with the twitches and tingling in my calves, general fatigue and heavy feeling of my legs when I walk. My primary care physician did a strength test on arms and legs and said it was normal. Can low vitamin B12 and vitamin D cause these symptoms? I just feel weird and scared.\t\t\t\t",

I have a very strong history of UTI by staying in long meetings and not going to toilets and holding the urine in for a long time during long drives.\u00a0\nIt all started when I was 19 years old, and I used to hold it during work and one day I was in pain after holding it from 8 PM to 3 AM.\u00a0Since then, I\u00a0have been suffering. My health started deteriorating from the past three years, since then I get frequent UTI every 3 to 5 months. And from last year, the urine flow has been affected. I am in pain, and I do not know what to do. I did an\u00a0ultrasound and many tests, which always says I have UTI. After taking a lot of fluids and Cystone, it gets cured and then in few days comes back. And when I do not have UTI, I have to go to the toilet frequently like once in every two hours.\u00a0\nAs I am getting older, it worries me that some ultrasound showed that I have a distended gallbladder and my prostate size as 27.\u00a0I do take Saw Palmetto, but I stopped since the prostate size is normal according to some urologist. The urologist said that the prostate could be infected. I feel like the bladder is not empty, every single time I go to the toilet, only a little pee comes out. I do not\u00a0want to do a cystoscopy, as the thought of it is agonizing. I have read that the size of the wire is as thick as a pencil.\u00a0I am looking for an alternative solution.\t\t\t\t",

    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi doctor,\nI am a 69 year old male and retired internist. Other than vitamins and prostate-related herbs, I take no medication. I have no allergies and have never smoked. My past medical or surgical history is rather unremarkable. I have had several bouts of acute sinusitis in years past. Four\u00a0weeks ago, my wife and I developed URTI. My illness had a sinus component featuring marked nasal and sinus congestion, postnasal drip, upper airway congestion and cough productive of clear sputum. I assumed the etiology was viral and treated it as such. After two weeks of little improvement, I assumed a bacterial etiology and initiated Augmentin 875 mg bid. After five days with little improvement, I switched to Cipro 500 mg bid. After four days, I saw my primary care doctor who prescribed Azithromycin 500 mg per day. Following the second day of treatment, I developed severe fatigue, generalized weakness and headache, which forced me to discontinue the Azithromycin. I then decided to wait until the Zithromax cleared my system before re-evaluating. After some eight days, I developed a purulent nasal discharge for which I again saw my primary care MD who prescribed Doxycycline 100 mg bid. Note that I requested a culture and sensitivity of the purulent discharge but was rebuffed. After 24 hours on Doxycycline, I felt greatly improved with little sinus pressure or congestion and minimal, clear nasal discharge. Now, on day four of Doxycycline, I have noted some return of the sinus pressure, post-nasal drip and nasal congestion. However, the mucus is clear. I was given a steroid nasal spray which only served to increase the mucosal irritation of my sinuses, nasal passages, throat and upper airways. I was never febrile at any point. I am exceedingly frustrated. Note that in the past I used Levaquin and developed marked insomnia and very lucid dreams when I was able to sleep. Please help.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "drugs like dutasteride acts by inhibition of conversion of testosterone to its more active and potent form of dihydrotestosterone. thus the side effects may include loss of libido erectile dysfunction low mood irritability and depression. although the frequency of such adverse effects is not very high but they are potentially frustrating. sometimes reduced libido may not be due to a direct side effect of dutasteride but is purely psychological. but still if you have noted significant reduction in sexual desire and erection i suggest you stop the medication. with prolonged use the condition may be irreversible and no doubt that would be more troublesome than loss of hair. let me give you two tips for both the problems. apply onion juice on scalp daily. it has got miraculous effect. consume three garlic cloves raw and crushed daily. you can swallow it with water. within a month you will see drastic improvement in libido and erection. onion juice contains sulfur which increases production of keratin. garlic on the other hand cleanses fat and cholesterol deposition from smaller blood vessels thus improving erections by supplying more blood to the penile tissues. for further information consult a sexologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "i clearly understand your symptoms. the basic reason behind the whole issue is the autonomic imbalance which your nervous system shows to specific sensory inputs. let me simplify that thing for you. all the senses give input to our brain like smell vision taste hearing and touch. out of these five the first two can have relatively major influence on our autonomic nervous system. the autonomic nervous system is the part of nervous system which regulates blood circulation digestion respiration cardiac rhythm etc. the alteration of blood flow in the brain produces those flashes of light and sometimes a lost patch of vision in a field. now people with migraine have little problem with these autonomic regulations and that is what is happening to you. the new smell is excessively disturbing your autonomic nervous system and so you have all the symptoms which you described. the olfactory system gets adapted relatively quickly. so if you continue to go there eventually you will get adopted. if that does not happen then you can use mechanical barriers such as a small mask to avoid the smell up to a certain extent but it may not help much. for nausea i suggest emefilm (ondansetron) 8 mg a thin mouth dissolving film of medicine to be kept below the tongue when you feel nauseated and topiramate 50 mg twice a day for headache. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. for further information consult a neurologist online --><link>",

    "answer": "natural estrogen is cardioprotective as it increases the level of hdl (high-density lipoprotein) and decreases the level of ldl (low-density lipoprotein). oxidation of ldl cholesterol is believed to be the initiator of atherosclerosis. estradiol and other estrogens are believed to inhibit this process. hormone replacement therapy - hrt rapidly increases the level of c-reactive proteins in the body a marker of inflammation associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. recently two major studies found that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer. another study proved that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of cardiac events and thrombosis. hence women should be advised to cease therapy postmenopause. however a detailed analysis showed that the time of initiating hrt postmenopause plays a crucial role. when initiated within five years of menopause in a healthy woman estrogen-based hrt has far more benefits than adverse outcomes. the pros of hrt includes: reduces symptoms of menopause. reduce osteoporosis dementia and colon cancer. improves cardiovascular system. the cons of hrt are: doubles the risk of thromboembolism. doubles the risk of breast cancer. so pros and cons are to be evaluated before initiating hrt in postmenopausal women. for more information consult a cardiologist online --><link>",

I am not getting it.\u00a0If it is cardioprotective, then why cannot it be given after 40 when estrogen levels in the\u00a0body\u00a0decrease? Also, I wanted to know, whether these side effects of oral contraceptive pills are dose dependent. Because, normally in young women estrogen is cardioprotective, but if given extra from the\u00a0outside, it is increased in the body than required and so, it cause complications. Is this true?

    "answer": "i read your concerns. i feel that topamax 200mg which works well for migraine has a little role in bipolar disorders. studies show that monotherapy with topamax is not recommended but instead of taking topamax you can try sodium valproate (depakote xr 750mg at night) which will be helpful to you in both your migraine and bipolarity. divalpoex sodium (depakote) has sedative property as a side effect. so it will be helpful to you in your insomnia. if you take 750 mg of dep. at night then you can reduce the night dosage of clonapin and gradually increase the dosage of depakote to 1000 mg and reduce the clonapin. you can also take 500mg in morning and 1000mg at night. and i feel that if you are feeling depressed then only you should take paxil otherwise there is no role of it in bipolar disorder. if your migraine is severe then you should take propranolol 10mg twice a day. but you have to take care about your heart because you complained about side effects of seroquel. propranolol is beta blocker it is used in prophylaxis for migraine. and i feel that if you use it you finally will get relief from your migraine. i do not know whether you have ever tried non benzos like zolpidem zopiclone eszopiclone. you should try that also for your sleep. i feel that these will satisfy some of your concerns. you can book for an online therapy at icliniq for further consultation with me either via video session or on phone.",

I also suffer from migraines, anxiety and insomnia.\nI am on topamax 100 mg twice a day, clonapin 0.5 thrice a day as needed, Paxil 10 mg in the morning (recently started) also for the insomnia I was started on elavil 25 mg on friday but I have not taken it yet because I noticed one of the side effects could cause QT prolongation which I do not know, but I am wondering if it is the same or very similar to the side effect of seroquel (arrthythmia as a side effect).\nI used to take seroquel for bipolar and insomnia, it worked well for about 6 months but then I started having instances every night where I went extremely tachycardic, could not breathe, turned blue and had to be rushed to the hospital. They were calling it a panic attack for several days before they figured out if it was the seroquel and my EKG was abnormal and it was too dangerous for me to be on and I could have died. Anyhow, I do not respond to any of the sleeping pills (the benzo ones) nor the highly sedating ones like the antipsychotics or even trazadone or benadryl or vistoryl or such.\nI am working on getting a sleep study, so this is my last option till then. Also, I cannot see my doctor until Thursday, and I feel like part of my insomnia is because my body has become dependent on the clonapin. I am trying not to take it at all, but my chest is starting to hurt, I am getting more anxiety and more headaches. How can I start to taper down before Thursday? What is the best way? I need to get better sleep. I am starting to really suffer. It has been 3 weeks of about 10 hours\u00a0of sleep\u00a0each week. Also, could Paxil give me more headaches?

There is a throbbing pain\u00a0on one corner of the head and generally the next day it almost definitely shifts to the other corner. This cycle continues. So, the frequency is around 2 headaches per week. I used to take\u00a0Paracetamol  and Aspirin though the medicines were not very effective. If the medicines are taken within the first half an hour of the beginning of pain, it gives reasonably good results. Two years back, my family doctor prescribed Sibelium 10 mg to be taken once every night. It gave me good results for a while but it increased my hours of sleep and resulted in weight gain and then the migraine attacks also started. My doctor prescribed Zen 200 mg to be taken every morning over and above Sibelium 10 mg in the night. This gave me very good results. Migraine attacks almost stopped.\u00a0I stopped taking Sibelium and Zen 200 mg was enough to control migraine unless I am travelling by car for over 3 hours. My doctor told that the clinical dose of Carbamazepine is 1600 mg per day and 200 mg is negligible. I gradually reduced the dose to 100 mg per day and then 100 mg twice or thrice a week. Later, though Carbamazepine is not considered as a pain abortive medicine, it worked for me. I used to take 100 mg tablet whenever required.\u00a0\nFor the last 6 months, I am feeling that I am suffering from memory loss. I used to have a very sharp memory. But, nowadays I forget names. Though, I do not forget events that much but my memory power of remembering names has become miserable. I even forget the name of a person I meet a week or a month ago. I have stopped taking Carbamazepine since June and I am taking Sibelium 10 mg whenever required, approximately twice a week, with good results. But, my memory especially in remembering names has become dull.\u00a0Please advice.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "one thing for sure is that he is having periodic hemolysis with adequate bone marrow response and he has a severe vitamin b12 deficiency. his corrected rpi (reticulocyte production index) is 2. 7% which means that his bone marrow is responding to the anemia appropriately. the broad differential here would be medication induced hypothyroidism vitamin b12 folate deficiency lead poisoning alcoholism and hemolysis due to ssd (sickle cell disease) or liver disease since he has transaminitis and elevated bilirubin. elevated ldh (lactate dehydrogenase) elevated reticulocyte count and low haptoglobin are indicators of hemolysis. he has splenomegaly as well which again favors either a chronic liver disease or most likely hemolysis. however the only tricky portion is his low wbc (white blood count). i do not think that it is a bone marrow process. it is more like peripheral destruction or nutritional deficiency. i do see that the vitamin b12 is very low at 209 and he has a normal g6pd level (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). i also reviewed that his bm was normal and his electrophoresis does not comment upon the sickle cell s or c disease. please mention whether he had any additional testing or work up for hemolytic anemia. i would like to know if he had a tsh done. why is he taking medications (all of them) including prednisolone azathioprine rituximab and mycophenolate? why is he not taking the vitamin b12 and vitamin d? these medications are toxic to bm and should not be used without a concrete diagnosis. revert back with the answers to the above questions to an internal medicine physician online --> <link>",

    "answer": "i have read your query in detail and do understand your concern. the conditions you have mentioned are not the risk factors for acquiring an hiv infection. the risk is there only if a drop of some hiv positive person's blood from the gun was transferred directly into your skin while tattooing. even then there is 3/1000 chances of you getting hiv from that drop of blood. so the probability of this happening is almost negligible. though hiv testing is not needed in your case but to relieve yourself from the associated anxiety you may get an elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for hiv test done after 12 weeks of possible exposure. the symptoms you have described are non-specific symptoms which can also be seen without any underlying cause and not indicative of hiv infection. for further doubts consult a hiv aids specialist online --> <link>",
    "question": "after receiving tattoo should i be concerned about hiv infection?",
    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi doctor,\nI received a tattoo recently. The artist used a new needle, a new tune and a new ink pot. The ink was poured directly into the ink pot from a larger bottle, and he throws the ink out after each tattoo. He did not clean the gun grip. He did clean my arm before the tattoo was applied and again when he was finished, along with various points throughout the tattoo. He did have me lay down on a sheet which he washes between clients. He continuously applied Vaseline to my skin throughout the tattoo, which had already been used for another client. From any of the above, is there a risk for HIV? Even though the needle was new, is there any chance of infection from the gun grip or Vaseline or even anywhere else in the process? Around 4 days later, I had extreme fatigue, nasal congestion, muscle aches and weakness in my lower legs. After 9 days, the fatigue went away, but the nasal congestion and muscle ache stayed. After 15 days, the muscle aches switched to the upper portion of my legs and I started getting pain in my neck. At the time, I had on and off sore throat and headache. I have not had any fever. Is there any reason to be concerned over a possible HIV infection here? My mono test and CBC came back normal after 20 days. I have been very stressed and worried. I really appreciate any advice on this matter. Thank you so much for your time and help.\t\t\t\t",

There was no fecal impaction, but my intestines were not moving. They gave me an NG tube to clean me out. My GI doctor prescribed me so many laxatives, but nothing worked. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy. They showed nothing, but a very stretched out colon and intestines. My doctor advised me that I can make my colon and intestine, normal with strict diet and laxatives. But still, I cannot produce a bowel movement without laxatives. If I do not take laxatives, then it will result in constipation. I have been diagnosed with IBS-C. I also get random vomiting. I have been on anti-reflux and nausea pills. I am scheduled for small bowel manometry, antroduodenal manometry, motility testing along with an endoscopy and colonoscopy. How long will this testing be? Do you think that another endoscopy and colonoscopy will help my condition? Though I had stomach pain for many years, why it ends up in hospital admission nowadays?

    "answer": "the risk of infection from needlestick injuries depends on: the factors that influence exposure to a greater volume of blood (for example: visible blood on the device needle which has been placed directly into an artery or a vein of an hiv positive person). viral load of the source patient. deeper injuries and by hollow-bore needles (especially those needles with larger gauges). diabetics use fine gauge needle and that too for injecting insulin into the skin rather than into a blood vessel. moreover the needlestick injury you have mentioned here actually did not prick deep enough you just touched the needle and i think your chances are minimal if at all. are you unsure about the hiv status of the patient? if you are sure that the used needle belongs to him and no one else and if you know the person very well you may straight away go and tell him/her about the incident and your reason to be anxious and inquire about the person's hiv status. that would be the easiest way. you may get a hiv combo test (antigen and antibody based test) done after 1 month of exposure for your own peace of mind. consult a hiv aids specialist online for further help --> <link>",

    "answer": "i understand your concern. i see two problems in your history. let me tell you the reason and solution. birth control pills come in a pack of 21 or 21 active plus seven dummy pills or the single dose of an emergency contraceptive pill. whichever you take will suppress your body's natural hormones. if you forget to take the pill in between or take it haphazardly your natural cycle is out of the track but do not worry as it can be corrected. get a urine pregnancy test done if not done recently. then have the same oral combined birth control pill (21 pills) twice a day for ten days and throw away the last pill. within next 7 to 10 days you will surely have your periods. all these bleeding on and off will disappear and then from the first day of the bleeding have the next packet of 21 pills once at night for 21 days. your bmi (body mass index) is more which is the bigger problem. from your history i presume you to have pcod (polycystic ovarian disease) this is usually associated with obesity irregular menstrual cycles no periods for few months followed by heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses spotting on and off. you develop an extra pad of fat around the mid segment of the body especially waist thighs and breast. excessive body hair growth hair fall dark lower half of the face acne oily face dark skin in the back of the neck inner thighs and under surface of the breast. pcos will not allow ovulation to occur at times and so you cannot get pregnant till treated. it also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. but this has a solution. just delay pregnancy for a few months as your weight has to be reduced. once you reduce your weight you would not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and the pregnancy will be healthy. i suggest you try the following to reduce weight. avoid fasting junk food and red meat. reduce snacks in between meals. have low calories and high-fiber diet. do regular exercise aerobics yoga and brisk walking. get your thyroid profile and serum prolactin test done in empty stomach. you can continue the same 21 pills packet to regularize periods till you shed some weight. try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. do not hurry on weight reduction as it will be difficult to maintain. as soon as you reduce at least 5 kg you will see changes. for further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

In that same week, I had unprotected sex with my fiance, and I had my periods the next day. The next month I got my periods two weeks earlier, and I thought it was because of stopping the birth control pills. But that period was like no other that I ever had in my life. The only time that I would bleed was when I want to go pee, and then a lot of dark red and thick blood would come out. I am having such periods since eight months now. I have also been feeling nauseous all the time, my head hurts, and my lower stomach feels funny. I have back pain, sore breast, the smell of some foods drive\u00a0me crazy, and I feel something moving around in my belly. I went to the doctor, but the pregnancy blood test came back negative, and the home pregnancy tests are also negative. I do not know what to do. I feel like something is going on in my body.

    "answer": "as the pregnancy tests were negative even after eight days post missed menses it ensures that you are not pregnant. the symptoms you had were common pms symptoms (premenstrual syndrome) which subsides slowly once the menses start. there is a possibility that a large endometrial chunk would have got passed out during the start of the flow due to delayed menses this time. so just allow the menses to continue and you should be fine. the chunk was definitely not a gestational sac or pregnancy as the pregnancy tests were negative. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "i can understand your concern. you are on 20 mg nexito (escitaprolam) modafinil 25 mg and 25 mg quetiapine even with these medicines your symptoms are persistent. so some minor changes in medicines will help you to come out of these symptoms. in suggest try taking amisulpride 25 to 50 mg in place of quetiapine it will help in reducing these negative symptoms. this will reduce the daytime sedation too. the dose of modafinil can be increased to 100 mg in the morning after breakfast. this will improve the daytime alertness and will surely improve your functioning. i advise you to get your thyroid function test and vitamin b12 levels done. hypothyroidism and low vitamin b12 levels are common reasons for persistent depressive symptoms. include vitamin b12 and omega-3 fatty acid supplements in your diet and you will surely see improvements. please follow these steps and consult your treating doctor about the dose adjustments. for more information consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>",

I am currently under a cardiologist due to fears that I have had a heart attack in the past and chronic chest discomfort. My cardiologist asked me to take a Holter monitor for 24-hours and the reports he gave me last week were normal. He said that everything was normal. He stated that my maximum pulse was 134 (while working hard), minimum 55 (while sleeping) and average 87. He did capture palpitations but said these were normal increases in pulse associated with activity. He stated that my ECG\u00a0shows Q wave. Though he said, that is not a pathological and I do not have right BBB,\u00a0(last week) he did, however,\u00a0referred me for an echocardiogram to reassure me. He also said that it would be very unlikely for it to be abnormal considering everything else normal.\nI have had lots of ECGs for the\u00a0last few months and all normal aside from the Q waves. I have also had my troponin levels monitored, and these too were normal. All doctors say that it is due to anxiety. Before four days, I was taken to A and E due to a sudden increase in pulse from 81 to 135. It then settled within 2 minutes, however as it had panicked me I attended A and E. In A and E, they checked my oxygen (99%), BP (153/92 mmHg) and my pulse (118). The ECG\u00a0showed normal, sinus tachycardia; however, I was concerned over what looked like ST elevation in AVR. When I asked for the second opinion, I was told that it is fine as it was only in one lead in AVR\u00a0and not an acute heart attack. I then requested a second ECG\u00a0as my pulse had gone down to 90s. It again showed normal sinus rhythm and no issues and was sent home from A and E. I have since been in a state of worry over my ECG,\u00a0which I have attached here. I would like to ask you if the ECG show\u00a0any issues aside from my usual Q waves. Also, my QRS is long on the new ECG and on this day I started a new course of medication called Omeprazole, which can allegedly cause changes to heart rhythm. Could this have caused my long QRS\u00a0and heart rate spike? I am a non-smoker, do not drink and have no family history of heart disease.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "the treatment includes some medicines and psychotherapy. 1) medication includes antidepressants (ssri's tci) antianxiety drugs. it is better to see some doctor before taking any medicine as the best medication for your panic attacks will depend on a variety of factors like presenting symptoms co morbid disorders and treatment goals. 2) psychotherapy (cbt i. e cognitive behaviour therapy) treatment of panic attacks. cbt works to help the patient to change his thoughts and perceptions that are contributing to fear and anxiety. once you begin to accept panic attacks you can start to change the way you respond to them. for example instead of reacting to physical symptoms with nerve-racking thoughts such as \u201ci am losing control \u201d you can respond to them with increased calm and clarity. relaxation techniques such as deep breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga can be practised to help you get in touch with your relaxation response. repeating positive affirmations such as \u201cdespite my anxiety i accept myself \u201d can also help in getting past fear. by working on changing how you react you can start to remain in control during panic attacks. the next time you have a panic attack try to remember the three a\u2019s of overcoming your fears: acknowledge accept and alternative response. these three steps can assist you in changing the way you react to symptoms and get through panic attacks with less fear. listed here is a simple step-by-step exercise that can help you overcome your fear of panic attacks: acknowledge - the next time you notice increased anxiety or panic symptoms simply pause and take a breath. take this moment to recognize that you are experiencing heightened panic and anxiety. this simple act of acknowledging your symptoms at the start of a panic attack can give you a sense of power over your fears. accept - rather than trying to run away from or resist your symptoms come to terms with the fact that you are having a panic attack. acceptance does not mean that you are giving in to panic but can provide you with the clarity needed to get through panic attacks. alternative response - instead of becoming wrapped up in your fear remind yourself that these are simply symptoms of a panic attack and that you have nothing to be afraid of. during a panic attack your flight-or-fight reaction may be trigger feelings of stress and fear. reframing these feelings can allow you to more effectively cope with them. so for example if during an attack you start to react with fear or a need to flee remind yourself that your symptoms will soon subside. instead of thinking \u201ci am afraid of my panic attack \u201d try to reframe this to \u201ci am feeling overly excited. \u201d when frightening thoughts such as \u201ci am going to lose my mind\u201d arise try to shift this perception be repeating to yourself \u201ci am okay \u201d or \u201cthese feelings will pass. \u201d you can book for an online therapy or telephone counseling for further counseling and treatment from us.",

    "answer": "yes you are right. hypothyroidism can affect the fetal brain development especially in early pregnancy. thyroid hormone is normally very important for many functions of the body. it helps in the early development of the fetus. the brain is one of the parts of early organ development. in early pregnancy fetus mainly depends on mother's thyroid level because fetus itself cannot produce up to around 11 to 12 weeks (three months). there is no data available whether you have taken treatment early and adequately. but yes there is data that hypothyroidism can affect brain development and function in baby permanently and whatever damage occurs is irreversible. if you are taking thyroxine (levothyroxine) 50 mg and the level is this high then you need to increase the dose. and if you have started treatment just now then continue and repeat according to the doctor. as far as termination is concerned that is totally the couple's call. if you are prepared to take care of a mentally handicapped baby and related problems for the rest of life then you can definitely continue. if you are not prepared for that then you can go for termination. first control thyroid level and then try for pregnancy after you have a normal thyroid level. you will have to take tablets for hypothyroidism for the rest of your life. only dose adjustment will be required time to time according to the thyroid level. so the last choice is yours. you know what can happen. if you are ready for it then go for it and do whatever you have to minimize that. get treated for hypothyroidism more aggressively and control as early as possible. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>",

    "answer": "i can understand your concern. first of all i would like to tell you that masturbation is not the reason for the problem of premature ejaculation you are having. masturbation is a safe habit and most of the men masturbate. diabetes increases the risk of premature ejaculation. so i would advise you to maintain the blood sugar levels. if that is not controlled then consult your doctor for dose adjustment of the drug. for premature ejaculation you can think of taking dapoxetine. the drug is a ssri drug (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and you can take it on as necessary basis. the drug will help to delay the time. the drug is safe to use and free of serious side effects. please talk to your doctor about the prescription of this drug. for further information consult a sexologist online --> <link>",

    "question": "does my ecg look like i have ever had a heart attack?",
    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi doctor,\nI am a 34 year old man. My weight is 22 stone, but I am pretty active despite my weight. I am neither easily fatigued from being active nor do I ever feel breathless other than normal. There is no history of peripheral artery disease in my family or coronary artery disease and to my knowledge; there has been no heart attack in my family or episodes of sudden cardiac death. I am a non-smoker and I do not drink alcohol.\nMy concern is that I suffer regularly with aches and pains in my legs, soles of feet, arms, shoulders and my chest. I do suffer costochondritis. The pain is never severe; it is more of a dull ache or a pulling sensation. If I had to rate the pain out of 10, I would say the discomfort is not more than 1 or 2 and maybe 3 at the worst. I feel that I have severe health anxiety and I do regularly check my pulse, blood oxygen and blood pressure. I have had numerous ECGs and of which, I will attach three for your reference. I have also had a coronary calcium score before 5 years, which was zero. I have had every blood test, including cardiac enzymes a number of times and my blood work is always normal except for borderline low testosterone. My cholesterol also in borderline and I am managing it through diet.\nInitially, I had chest pain before six years. I had a consultation with my GP and he organized a coronary calcium score due to a dramatically elevated cholesterol level. CCS was normal and I began a treatment of Atorvastatin. There was no further issue for the next three years. Then, when I was involved in moving a disabled person from a high rise apartment and was lugging furniture and other household items up and down five flights of stairs, I felt unwell, chest discomfort and pain in the arms. Also, I felt dizzy and fast pulse. I attended A and E promptly and they performed an ECG. But, it showed nothing and cardiac enzymes were also normal. The only thing there was an inverted T-wave, which the cardiologist was not concerned with as it was only in one lead.\nTwo years ago, I attended A and E again with chest pain. Another ECG was performed along with a chest x-ray and all of which were normal. I was kept in overnight for routine observation and in the morning I was visited by a cardiologist. He felt that the issue was muscular and not cardiac in origin and I was subsequently sent home. Before 10 months, I attended my GP surgery to discuss my past and was told that it was a likely anxiety disorder. To settle my mind, I asked my GP to perform an ECG and the machine autogenerated a diagnosis of possible peri-infarction age undetermined. This subsequently triggered a panic episode. My GP checked it and said if I had been presented this ECG without the autogenerated diagnosis then he would say it was a perfectly normal ECG. As I asked for a second opinion, he sent my diagnosis to a cardiologist. The reply sent was I find it highly unlikely that this gentleman has ever had an MI. However, if he is still concerned, then consider a referral for stress echocardiogram.\nI opted for the stress echo. When I met with the consultant cardiologist, he told me that it was not anything to worry about as everything appeared normal and was basically an anxiety based. He advised no further tests necessary and discharged me as healthy with a diagnosis of GAD. Before three months, I attended A and E with chest pain and discomfort following a stressful day. Another ECG was taken and everything was normal apart\u00a0from Q waves in lead 3. A and E consultant examined ECG and reported no change from earlier ECGs. A month later, I had an ambulance call out to the home address. Two ECGs were taken in one hour difference. The first again showed inferior infarction, age undetermined and QRS duration (corrected) 491 ms. Ambulance crew said it is fine and otherwise a normal ECG. All other observations are normal with oxygen 99% and somewhat high BP. It was likely anxiety again. The second ECG showed a normal QRS duration and no other issues. I was advised to see GP for anxiety medicines\nI visited my GP last month. He repeated ECG again and it was normal. He gave me Sertraline and said based on my entire history that it is definitely not a cardiac chest pain. From last month, I started a new job at the hospital. Due to shoulder pain and leg pain, I attended A and E and an ECG was performed allegedly and it did not show any of the previous Q waves from earlier ECG's and appeared completely normal. The cardiac enzymes were taken and were reported normal. The final diagnosis was anxiety. Yet, again, I attended A and E in the last month as my fitbit showed that my pulse was elevated to 159. When I rushed to A and E, my pulse was 144. On arrival at A and E, I had my BP taken 154/94 mmHg. My spo2 was 100% and pulse was 114. Another ECG was performed and the nurse informed me that everything normal except QTC. So, I was asked to repeat an ECG by the consultant there. The second one was reported to be normal. In the meantime, I had panicked and checked on the internet regarding QTc durations and learnt about sudden cardiac death due to the long QTc syndrome. The nurse very bluntly told me that it was very highly unlikely to happen to me as I had no other symptom. Again, I was just diagnosed with anxiety.\nI have still been getting the pain in the back of my leg, around the sole of my foot, shoulder and a very slight ache in my jaw. Also, I feel some chest pain, but I relate this to my costochondritis. Please be aware that all the pain mentioned above is the same that I have presented with for a number of weeks or months and have attended A and E. Is it true that all this can be due to anxiety? Should I worry about QTc? Does my ECG look like I have ever had a heart attack? What could be causing the other pains? Sometimes, while taking a rest, my fitbit reports my pulse to be as low as 54 and when walking my pulse tends to be around 114 to 120 bpm. When it is around 120, I can feel my heart beat.\nOne thing that is new and has recently nerved me is the ability to hear my pulse most often after running up my flight of stairs from living room to bedroom. The heartbeat can be heard externally for only a few seconds, maybe 10 at the most and then settles back to normal. This incidence occurs when I am highly anxious, during pre-anxiety attacks and only when I have done something like running upstairs. Recorded pulse during this audible heart  beat is usually 120, but then within 2 minutes again that will drop to normal range. In fact, I have clocked my pulse at 136 and after 30 seconds it has dropped to 96. I am just concerned about the actual audible heartbeat. Please help me.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "the best way to reduce weight is by regular physical exercise and balanced diet. you can lose weight by reducing your intake of oily food and sweets. it is also important to space your meals in such a way that you have more frequent small meals (and not heavy meals). regular physical exercise in the form of some cardio and strength training will make you fit and strong. sleep and hydration are equally important when you try to lose weight. ensure that you take lots of fluids and that you get at least 6-8 hours of sleep per day. medicine to lose weight: as a doctor i never really recommend my patients to take medicines to lose weight. only one drug is approved for use in india- orlistat. if you really want to take it you can take tablet orlistat 60mg thrice a day (after your 3 major meals). as i have seen in practice and also research results say that orlistat does not produce too much change in weight. it shows just a small percentage of weight loss when coupled with low-calorie diet and exercise. and orlistat has its own share of side effects: fatty/oily stool oily spotting intestinal gas with discharge a feeling of needing to have a bowel movement right away increased number of bowel movements or poor bowel control. rare but serious side effects can occur: symptoms of liver disease (such as persistent nausea/vomiting severe stomach/abdominal pain dark urine yellowing eyes/skin) symptoms of kidney stones (such as back pain pain while urinating pink/bloody urine). bottom line: i do not recommend medicines for weight loss. i can make a good diet chart and exercise regimen for you if you would like to follow up in which case you will have to get back to me with your details- your daily food routine your work timings your daily sleep cycle the kind of exercises you prefer etc. i hope that answers your question. revert back to a fitness expert online --> <link>",

During the oral sex I had no protection. Next day I started having pain on my testicles and my stomach. I was feeling weak the whole time and after a week I gave urine and semen for culture. The urine culture was clean and the semen culture\u00a0with\u00a0bacterium E. coli has been detected. It is worth mentioning that I am suffering from prostatitis and I have been diagnosed and treated for more than 3 years with almost the same bacterium, which I thought has been eliminated. Also on that day, we had sex 3 times within 5 hours and I am thinking whether the intensity of that might have brought back the E. coli or it was still there and it appears now. I do not know therefore this is my first question.\nSince the oral sex was not protected, can it be that she passed me the E. coli? Or is it due to my prostatitis? After my semen results the doctor asked me to take Tavanic 500 mg once per day for one month. I am now on the first week, the pain is still there but comparatively less. I still feel pressure on the lower part of my stomach and also since last 3 weeks I feel my stomach always full and not so comfortable. Can this be a side effect of the E. coli or something else? I had no fever since then and I did not lose my appetite but I am feeling full. Apart from the E. coli that I need to finish my treatment, now I do have a fear whether I have been infected with any other STDs. If yes, the semen and urine culture should have normally shown something abnormal. Also I have a fear if because of the oral sex, I might have been infected with HIV, could this be possible? Should I do HIV test? If yes which kind of HIV test can give me a fast indication. Thank you.\t\t\t\t",

    "answer": "mirap is a mirtazapine which is indicated for depression. in my professional experience it is not as efficacious as the ssris such as fluoxetine or paroxetine or citalopram. mirap at the dosage of 15mg does help the patient to sleep better but it is also known for significant weight gain upto 10lbs in 2 weeks. clonazepam is indeed an useful adjunct and helps with the anxiety component. but i only prefer to use it as an \"as needed adjunct\" and no standing doses. i can help you better if you are fine with booking a session for an online therapy for a detailed evaluation.",
